                data on company ethics transparent and accessible. </h1>
            <p> We are building a community-curated, transparent, freely
                accessible collection of corporate ethics records. By
                documenting ethical and unethical business practices,
                we aim to inform consumer choice, raise the cost of
                harmful business decisions, and incentivise companies to
                act responsibly in the public interest. </p>
            <p> All of our services
                and data are offered free to the public under the terms of
                the GPL v3 licence. </p>
