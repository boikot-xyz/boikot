Child Labor and the Human Rights Violations Embedded in Producing Technology

Every new Apple release comes with a media blitz about the new iPhone’s improved camera quality, the speed of the M1 processor chip in the latest MacBooks, or the sound quality of the next generation AirPod Pros. An Apple product’s design interface is carefully curated—all with the goal of arousing a feeling of sleekness and fashion in the consumer. However, despite Apple’s futuristic facade, its labor model is backwards and deeply problematic. Indeed, Apple’s cobalt batteries are built on the backs of child labor in mines, causing severe physical harm to children and violating international standards of human rights.

Under status quo international human rights law, corporations avoid the scrutiny that polices individuals or governments. While some corporations’ treatment of their workers would technically constitute blatant rights violations, current international law leaves the responsibility of prosecuting corporations to nation-states rather than international courts. The harms of this practice become painfully obvious when countries without transparent and respected legal institutions overlook extreme worker exploitation, particularly when it comes to technology companies’ resource extraction practices. Consequently, the inextricable link between large corporations and their subsidiary companies which extract resources for them must be considered to ensure corporate accountability. In order to prevent human rights violations from remaining unprosecuted, a new system of human rights law must be created to hold corporations accountable for human rights abuses—and not just for the local companies abusing their workers’ rights during resource extraction, but the multinational corporations who enable and profit from this abuse.

Unlike individuals and governments, for whom the United Nations (UN) provides clear frameworks for prosecution, the language of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which defines corporate responsibility to uphold human rights, is less constraining. Paragraph 12 reads, “the responsibility of business enterprises to respect human rights refers to internationally recognized human rights.” [1] However, this responsibility is implied to be a moral one, not a legal one. In the Commentary to the UN Guiding Principles concerning Paragraph 12, the prospect of legal ramifications is removed for corporations: “the responsibility of business enterprises to respect human rights is distinct from issues of legal liability and enforcement, which remain defined largely by national law provisions in relevant jurisdictions.” [2] With this statement, the international enforcement mechanisms that prosecute human rights violators—both individuals and governments—cannot affect multinational corporations accused of abusing human rights. Rather, domestic laws are left responsible, and thus, in countries with institutions biased towards corporate needs or underserved institutions that fail to uphold rule of law, corporations can wholly escape legal ramifications. While the International Criminal Court (ICC) has the ability to prosecute international law violators under the Rome Statute if a domestic country is unwilling or unable to do so, this prosecution only occurs for war crimes and crimes against humanity. While child labor is a serious harm, it is not the primary intent of corporations, but rather a consequence of their severe negligence, whereas the ICC exclusively covers systemic and intentional human rights violations such as genocide, torture, and the slaughtering of civilians. [3] Thus, human rights violations committed by multinational corporations do not rise to the level of severity needed for the ICC to override domestic legal mechanisms.

Alternatively, another route for legal recourse is to sue corporations in their state(s) of origin—for example, the United States—if the rule of law and legal structures in that country are better equipped to tackle the relevant human rights concerns. One attempt to apply this form of recourse was the landmark 2013 U.S. Supreme Court case Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum. In the United States, the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) gives federal courts jurisdiction over prosecuting international law violations committed against foreign nationals. [4] The petitioners in the case argued that the Royal Dutch Shell oil company was complicit in the Nigerian government’s human rights violations, which include the military committing mass extrajudicial murder against the Ogoni people to promote its oil drilling in Ogoni land—killing over one thousand people. [5] Ultimately, the Court rejected this case. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts stated that if the ATS were to be applied to any case involving a multinational corporation abroad, then U.S. courts would find themselves constantly meddling in foreign jurisdictions. [6] To the Supreme Court, the embedded presumption against using the ATS in extraterritorial circumstances means the ATS can only be applied if the case’s damages display “sufficient force to displace the presumption against extraterritorial application,” which would occur if the United States’ territory was impacted in some way by the damages. [7] Thus, the case’s precedent means that the sale of a good to the United States, even one so important and widely purchased like petroleum, does not sufficiently impact the United States enough to justify legal intervention. Therefore, the Kiobel case further limits countries’ ability to protect human rights abroad if the foreign country in which violations occur does not already have the mechanisms in place to prosecute human rights violators.

The failures of prosecuting transnational corporations for their rights abuses is not just limited by the difficulty of prosecuting relevant actors, but also by those of holding accountable the larger system that enables and finances exploitative resource extraction. In a pending court case in the United States Circuit Court for the District of Columbia, Doe 1-13 et al. v. Apple Inc., et al., Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, and Dell are all named as defendants being sued by the families of Congolese children who were killed or maimed in cobalt mines owned by smaller companies sourced by these corporations. [8] The extent of these rights abuses is expansive. Aside from the already egregious human rights concerns regarding children working hard labor, the suit asserts that children earn slave wages and that many have been permanently disabled or killed due to poor, unregulated working conditions. Indeed, one child was even buried alive and killed by a collapsed tunnel. [9] Yet, with legal precedents such as Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum, it is difficult for a U.S. court to hold companies accountable: the mining processes are completely divorced from the United States and therefore fail to meet the “sufficient force” criteria set by this precedent. While the technology corporations’ defense is that the mining companies are at fault for mining practices, blame must also be put upon the benefactor of such a project, especially given their awareness of the human rights abuses. [10] If blame is not adjudicated to corporate benefactors, then such actors can always hide behind smaller companies to carry out their exploitation.

To solve these problems, new international forums must be created to prosecute corporate perpetrators. For instance, to combat Africa’s specific issue with poor legal institutions, the African Union (AU) added a criminal chamber to the African Court of Justice and Human Rights, with specific parameters for the prosecution of corporate actors. [11] Article 46A of the newly-adopted protocol outlines two key steps towards corporate accountability. First, knowledge of rights violations held by persons within the corporation can be prosecuted. Second, any rights violations, even if they are not formalized in corporate policy, make corporations legally culpable as long as there is proof of internal knowledge of an action’s negative ramifications on others’ human rights. [12] This addition to the protocol clearly is a large leap in limiting exploitation of workers in Africa by powerful multinational companies. Furthermore, the AU’s addition also grants the African Court of Justice and Human Rights the ability to, like the ICC, refuse cases if they have been properly prosecuted at a domestic level. [13] Therefore, the court may determine if a violation was properly prosecuted domestically, and hold an international trial to supplement cases with insufficient domestic trials. Importantly, the usage of international courts to prosecute companies allows for the setting of necessary precedents. Absent international enforcement, if a company is found guilty of exploitative practices in a domestic court, it may simply carry out the same practices in a different nation. However, with the formation of regional international courts, the precedent set by a guilty verdict would regulate domestic courts’ approach to corporations across the region, and when that is still not sufficient, would create a forum to prosecute corporations directly.

The formation of new modes for enforcement is not sufficient, however, because it still fails to account for the involvement of larger financing networks. Specifically, the immediate rights violators—those whom the courts have jurisdiction over—are often not the multinational corporations who are benefactors of abusive practices. Thus, for a case such as Doe 1-13 et al. v. Apple Inc., et al., courts still may not find Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, and Dell guilty, because these corporations are not operating the human right-violating mines, even though the localized mining companies that they invest in and purchase from are.

In addition, large technology companies have distanced themselves from their mining subsidiaries’ wrongdoings by creating elaborate publicity efforts to appear ignorant of the abuses. As asserted by the plaintiffs in Doe 1-13 et al. v. Apple Inc., et al., Apple created a voluntary reporting system for citizens to notify Apple if they sourced resources from prohibited child labor sources. [14] Apple’s 2018 “Statement on Efforts to Combat Human Trafficking and Slavery in Our Business and Supply Chain” reads, “[we] continued to support the International Tin Association’s International Tin Supply Chain Initiative whistleblowing mechanism in the [Democratic Republic of the Congo] that allows people to anonymously voice concerns in their local language related to the extraction, trade, handling, and export of minerals so allegations of misconduct can be surfaced and reported.” [15] Co-defendants Microsoft, Dell, Tesla, and Alphabet have identical systems of reporting. [16] However, as expressed by the plaintiffs in Doe, it is unrealistic for companies to expect impoverished and vulnerable populations to hold them accountable for their actions. Furthermore, the presence of a violent governmental regime that “does not tolerate dissent and an unregulated industry that could retaliate with impunity against any whistleblowers” in these regions makes it all the more evident that the corporations are unwilling to facilitate actual accountability measures. Corporations are often completely knowledgeable about the violations they enable; yet, they intentionally hide their involvement behind a facade of corporate transparency. [17]

Thus, if international courts such as those in the AU expanded their definition of rights violations to include the intentional financing or support of abusive companies, then the entire chain of corporate responsibility for an illegal action can be held accountable. This would also make it more difficult for large companies to successfully formulate elaborate publicity schemes, as it would explicitly make them a subject of investigation.

As new technologies emerge and resource demands increase, the future of human rights violations may very well manifest in the private sector. If institutions do not uphold the rule of law in prosecuting every human rights violator—even if said perpetrators do not align with traditional narratives on human rights framed in terms of individual and state actors—they fail their core mission to uphold human rights for all. Thus, new international forums must be created to supersede domestic prosecutorial efforts when necessary in order to prosecute corporate rights violators. Furthermore, forums must also account for the larger role that corporate partnerships play in the perpetuation of abusive resource extraction, so that direct and indirect actors alike can be held accountable. If international legal bodies are staunchly committed to preventing rights abuses when perpetrated by governments or powerful individuals, then there is no reason why profiteering corporations should get a free pass.

For Release: 06/03/2010
FTC Investigation of Ad Claims that Rice Krispies Benefits Children's Immunity Leads to Stronger Order Against Kellogg

Leading cereal maker Kellogg Company has agreed to new advertising restrictions to resolve a Federal Trade Commission investigation into questionable immunity-related claims for Rice Krispies cereal. This is the second time in the last year that the FTC has taken action against the company.

“We expect more from a great American company than making dubious claims – not once, but twice – that its cereals improve children’s health,” said FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz. “Next time, Kellogg needs to stop and think twice about the claims it’s making before rolling out a new ad campaign, so parents can make the best choices for their children.”

Kellogg has agreed to expand a settlement order that was reached last year after the FTC alleged that the company made false claims that its Frosted Mini-Wheats cereal was “clinically shown to improve kids’ attentiveness by nearly 20%.”

At about the same time that Kellogg agreed to stop making these kinds of false claims in its cereal ads, the company began a new advertising campaign promoting the purported health benefits of Rice Krispies, according to the FTC. On product packaging, Kellogg claimed that Rice Krispies cereal “now helps support your child’s immunity,” with “25 percent Daily Value of Antioxidants and Nutrients – Vitamins A, B, C, and E.” The back of the cereal box stated that “Kellogg’s Rice Krispies has been improved to include antioxidants and nutrients that your family needs to help them stay healthy.”

Under the original settlement order covering Frosted Mini-Wheats, Kellogg was barred from making claims about the benefits to cognitive health, process, or function provided by any cereal or any morning food or snack food unless the claims were true and substantiated.

The expanded order against Kellogg prohibits the company from making claims about any health benefit of any food unless the claims are backed by scientific evidence and not misleading.

The Commission vote to modify the 2009 settlement order was 5-0, with Commissioner Julie Brill and Chairman Jon Leibowitz issuing a separate joint concurring statement. “As a trusted, long-established company with a presence in millions of American homes, Kellogg must not shirk its responsibility to do the right thing when it advertises the food we feed our children,” they wrote in the statement, which can be found on the FTC’s website and as a link to this press release at: http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0823145/100602kelloggstatement.pdf.

Copies of the expanded order and related documents can be found on the FTC’s website and also are available from the FTC’s Consumer Response Center, Room 130, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20580.

NOTE: A consent agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission of a law violation. When the Commission issues a consent order on a final basis, it carries the force of law with respect to future actions. Each violation of such an order may result in a civil penalty of up to $16,000.

The Federal Trade Commission works for consumers to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair business practices and to provide information to help spot, stop, and avoid them. To file a complaint in English or Spanish, visit the FTC’s online Complaint Assistant or call 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357). The FTC enters complaints into Consumer Sentinel, a secure, online database available to more than 1,800 civil and criminal law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and abroad. The FTC’s website provides free information on a variety of consumer topics.

In a shocking revelation, IKEA has been found guilty of logging in a protected rainforest, sparking widespread outrage and concern among environmentalists and consumers alike. The Swedish furniture giant, known for its affordable and stylish home furnishings, has faced allegations of unsustainable forestry practices in the past, but this latest development marks a significant escalation.

According to reports, IKEA's suppliers were found to have cleared large areas of the protected rainforest, violating local laws and regulations. The logging was allegedly carried out to source wood for IKEA's furniture products, highlighting the complex and often opaque supply chains that underpin the company's operations.

- Source [3]:
In a shocking revelation, IKEA has come under fire for sending approximately 150 tonnes of brand-new, usable furniture to landfill. This staggering statistic has sparked widespread criticism, with many questioning the company's commitment to sustainability and waste reduction.

The discarded furniture, deemed "unsellable" by IKEA's quality control standards, raises important questions about the company's production processes and waste management practices. With many of the items still in perfect condition, the decision to send them to landfill has been met with outrage from environmentalists and consumers alike.

This incident highlights the issue of waste and excess in the furniture industry, particularly among large-scale manufacturers like IKEA. As one of the world's largest furniture retailers, IKEA has a responsibility to lead the way in sustainable practices and minimize waste.

As a company based in Sweden, which is home to some of the world’s most powerful unions, you would think that IKEA would be an employer that understood the importance of workers’ rights.

And if you read what the company says about itself, it sounds wonderful.

On their website, IKEA says that it takes into consideration “at a minimum” the following: “the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.”

That’s quite a mouthful. And it means nothing.

IKEA has a long and unpleasant history when it comes to respecting workers rights and indeed the use of forced labour.

A decade ago, following some very negative publicity, IKEA commissioned an accounting company to look into its practices in East Germany during the Cold War. To no one’s surprise (certainly not a surprise to the people running IKEA) it turned out that both political and criminal prisoners in the Stalinist state were used to manufacture the company’s iconic flat pack furniture. The accountants determined that IKEA was almost certainly aware that political prisoners were used to make their products. From the company’s point of view, hiring what were effectively slaves ensured a higher rate of profit, certainly lowering labour costs compared to what they might have had to pay in Sweden. IKEA apologised, insisting that this would never happen again.

But just three months ago, IKEA was in the news yet again. The last remaining fully Stalinist state in Europe, Belarus, was the focus of attention this time. “Over the past several days, news reports in various markets have focused on the presence of IKEA in Belarus before 2022,” stated the company, “including allegations of the use of forced prison labour connected to sub-suppliers. We, at IKEA, take these reports seriously, and are concerned. We are investigating the claims.”

The founder of the Ikea furniture chain, Ingvar Kamprad, is facing further questions about his Nazi past following claims in a new book.

Author Elisabeth Asbrink says Mr Kamprad was an active recruiter for a Swedish Nazi group, and stayed close to sympathisers well after World War II.

The details go beyond what Mr Kamprad has previously admitted.

The Swedish billionaire has said his involvement was youthful "stupidity", and the "greatest mistake" of his life.

In her book, Ms Asbrink says Mr Kamprad actively recruited people to the fascist Sweden's Socialist Union (SSS).

She says the activity prompted security police to set up a file on him in 1943 when he was 17 - the same year that he founded Ikea.

Ms Asbrink says the security police intercepted his post, and noted that he "had some sort of functionary position" in a youth Nazi organization.

Roger Whiteside, the departing chief executive of Greggs, received a total package of £1.9m.

Advisers say shareholders with a stake in steak bake retailer should vote against remuneration report at AGM
Sarah Butler
Wed 11 May 2022 18.58 BST

Bakery chain Greggs is facing a potential shareholder revolt over high pay for its executives after criticism by two respected investor advisory groups.

Bonus payouts for Greggs’ outgoing chief executive, Roger Whiteside, amounted to more than double his basic salary of £575,209, taking his total package to £1.9m including benefits.

As a result the investment adviser Pirc said shareholders should vote against the bakery chain’s remuneration report at the group’s annual meeting on 17 May, noting that Whiteside’s pay was excessive and amounted to 79 times that of a regular employee.

Meanwhile the proxy adviser Glass Lewis pointed to a 11.4% rise in basic pay for Greggs’ finance chief, Richard Hutton, last year that was followed by a 3.5% increase this year to £393,300.

He is also lined up for an exceptional share bonus payout of 150% of salary despite Greggs not paying back £87m in government furlough support received in 2020. It did pay back £4.9m in furlough support received last year.

Greggs said it had approved the higher potential payout for Hutton this year because he was “critical in helping to support [the] transition” from Whiteside to new boss Roisin Currie.

“The committee believes his knowledge and experience will be essential and therefore his long-term incentive award should be appropriately pitched to reflect the key contribution he is expected to make over the next few years,” the company said.

However, Glass Lewis said Greggs’ board has “failed to provide a robust rationale” for the higher than usual bonus for Hutton – which would usually be limited to a maximum of 125% of salary.

Greggs’ remuneration committee said its annual bonus scheme had been “designed to ensure that bonus payments would only be made for appropriately stretching levels of performance”.

It added: “The committee is cognisant that the payout of the bonus is very near to maximum but is satisfied that this outcome aligns well with the business performance in what were tough trading conditions in 2021.”

On the additional share bonus, it said it was “very comfortable that vesting” was justified.

The criticisms of Greggs come after a string of shareholder rebellions over pay this spring. Almost 30% of shareholders in Ocado rebelled against high pay for directors at the online grocery specialist this month after it laid out a plan to pay the chief executive, Tim Steiner, up to £100m over the next five years.

And just over 38% of shareholders who voted came out against a new bonus scheme at GlaxoSmithKline, which raised the annual bonus for executives at the drugs group from two times to three times their salaries.

Almost a third of Standard Chartered’s shareholders voted against executive pay at its annual meeting, after advisers criticised the bank for not sufficiently cutting bonuses after a record UK regulatory fine.

Nearly 11% of voting shareholders opposed the pay policy at Barclays on the same day.

However, NatWest executives avoided a shareholder rebellion despite a controversial new pay policy that could net the bank’s chief executive, Alison Rose, as much as £5.2m a year. Nearly 93% of shareholder votes were cast in favour of the policy last month.

Greggs' pastries, pies and bakes ranked worst to best

Feeling overwhelmed by Greggs' plethora of bakes, slices, pasties, pastries and so on? Don't worry - we've tried 'em all so you don't have to
Tuesday 9 June 2015
Share
Written by Niki Boyle

Our sister site Time Out London recently launched a feature ranking all 32 of the sandwiches available at Pret A Manger, and it caused quite a furore. The thing is, outside of London, Pret's not really that big a deal.

Greggs, on the other hand, is. These lunchtime saviours and hangover banishers have been keeping the population of this fair country well stocked in pastry-wrapped deliciousness for years, and over that time we've built up something of a fondness for them. 

Now, for the first time ever*, the Greggs savoury selection has been sampled and ranked; now, once and for all, there can be no more arguments** about which slice, pastry, pasty, lattice, bake or bridie is best. We know. Read on to find out.

* We have done literally no research to verify this claim.
** There will undoubtedly be arguments. Have your say in the comments.
14. Pork, apple and stuffing lattice
Pork, apple and stuffing lattice
The Greggs seasonal specials are a mixed bag - for every glorious spicy chicken and chorizo slice, there's an abomination like this. The stuffing is sludge, the pork is non-existent and the apple is cubed asbestos. Thankfully, it's for a limited time only.

Been there, done that? Think again, my friend.

13. Scotch pie
Scotch pie
With considerable effort, it's possible to make a scotch pie that isn't something you chuck down your gullet and hope for the best. This pie lacks that effort. The mince is slimy and the rock-hard crust will tear your gums.
12. Cheese and onion pasty
Cheese and onion pasty
As one of the few Greggs veggie options, this one has a loyal following, but there's no getting around it: cheese and onion is a crime against flavour combinations. It's bad enough in crisp form; this lumpy-custard-like hellion takes that to the next level.
11. Cheese and onion roll
Cheese and onion roll
It's the exact same thing but disguised as a sausage roll. Doesn't make it taste any better, but you get the impression there's less of it, hence the higher ranking.
10. Chicken bake
Chicken bake
If diced chicken and gloopy, lukewarm mayo is your idea of a good time, this is the one for you. And we'll be honest - sometimes it's our idea of a good time too. But not often.
9. Steak and cheese roll
Steak and cheese roll
A relative newcomer to the Greggs stable, this young pretender attempts to be a 'new twist' on the classic Philly combo. Sadly, that twist involves replacing traditional provolone with Stilton (seriously - of all the cheeses...) and shredding the beef til it's devoid of any texture. It's still a rich, flavoursome experience, but the method of delivery is lacking.
8. Macaroni pie
Macaroni pie
The macaroni pie (apparently largely unheard except in Scotland and, according to Wikipedia, Trinidad and Tobago) seems like a slam-dunk of an idea - a nostalgia-provoking childhood favourite, encased in a pie crust for easy portability. Sadly, that crust is still hazardous to gums (see our earlier scotch pie comments), but the filling is still spot-on, if you don't mind it being not-quite-al-dente.
7. Vegetable pasty
Vegetable pasty
The highest-ranking vegetarian option on our list tastes like the solidifed version of that veggie soup your nan used to make, with maybe a sprinkling of extra pepper. It's by turns spicy and comforting, just like nan. Kind of.
6. Bacon and cheese melt
Bacon and cheese melt
Picture the scene: Gregg Junior has just concocted a new, hangover-destroying cheese, bacon and pastry combo - but he doesn't have enough pastry for the top layer! 'Not to worry, son,' says Gregg Senior with a wise old twinkle in his eye, 'just fold it over, pop it in the oven and you'll have a perfectly servicable turnover. Oh, and mind add loads of salt to it.' Combine with Irn Bru for optimum revivifying effect.
5. Bridie
Bridie
Another regionally-specific Greggs offering (do they have Cornish pasties further south, perhaps?), the bridie tastes better than any simple combination of mince, onions and pastry has a right to. One of the few items in the Greggs repertoire that genuinely feels nourishingly good for you.

4. Sausage roll
Sausage roll
The classic - nothing special, but then its very basicness (and careful configuration of the flaky-to-greasy pastry ratio) is what makes the sausage roll an everyman's favourite.
3. Sausage, cheese and bean melt
Sausage, cheese and bean melt
Now this is just a masterpiece in breakfast engineering. While the sauce in other Greggs slices errs on the side of thickness, this viscous tomato-and-baked-bean mixture absolutely nails the formula, no doubt aided by the binding qualities of well-melted cheese. Some structural support in the shape of several processed sausages brings the whole thing together nicely.
2. Steak bake
Steak bake
The chicken bake we checked off earlier suffered from a lack of chunkiness; this hearty number couples some satisfyingly meaty beefy bits with a rich (but not too thick) gravy. Delish.
1. Festive bake
Festive bake

There are two schools of thought on the above picture:

(a) our photographer was so overcome by the combination of chicken, bacon, sage & onion stuffing, gravy and cranberry & red onion relish that he couldn't restrain himself and devoured it before he knew what he was doing; or

(b) it's not Christmas so we couldn't get hold of one. Whichever one you believe (it's the second one), we know we're far from alone in declaring the Festive Bake king of the Greggs savoury range - as far as we're aware, it's the only such product to have inspired its own Facebook group and Iceland product line. We're already counting the sleeps til Christmas.

Mitchells & Butlers and Greggs among firms named for failing to pay minimum wage

Greggs and Mitchells & Butlers are among over 500 companies that have been named by the government for failing to pay some of their staff the minimum wage.



The 524 businesses listed by the Department for Business and Trade breached national minimum wage law and owed almost £16m to 172,000 workers combined.



Pub and restaurant operator Mitchells & Butlers, which is behind brands including Miller & Carter and All Bar One, ranked fifth in the list for failing to pay £565,094.87 to 16,187 workers, while Greggs came 11th for failing to pay £219,129.07 to 4,793 workers.



Meanwhile, Stonegate Pub Company, which owns brands such as Slug & Lettuce and Be at One, ranked 21st for failing to pay £101,044.67 to 3,650 staff.



A spokesperson for Mitchells & Butlers said: “Our minimum hourly pay has never been below the national minimum wage. As the minister notes, not all underpayments are intentional and this was the case here.



"The HMRC review of our pay practices, which concluded in 2019, identified a technical misinterpretation of the regulations. All arrears due were paid to our valued employees and ex-employees at the end of the review and we have updated our policies where necessary.”



A spokesperson for Greggs said: “During a review with HMRC, it was brought to our attention that our uniform policy for retail colleagues was not aligned with HMRC's interpretation of national minimum wage regulations, and as a result, we revised our uniform policy in January 2018.



"Once the review was concluded, we reimbursed colleagues and former colleagues who had been impacted by this unintended error.”



The Caterer understands Stonegate owed roughly £27 to each affected person between 2015 and 2019, which has since been repaid.



All the businesses in the list have since paid back what they owe to their staff, as well as additional financial penalties of up to 200% of their underpayment.



The announcement comes ahead of the 9.8% National Living Wage hike that is set to come into force on 1 April, which will raise hourly pay from £10.42 to £11.44.



Kevin Hollinrake, minister for enterprise, markets and small business, said: “Employees deserve to get paid properly for the hard work they put in.



“While the majority of businesses already do the right thing and pay their staff what they are owed, this announcement sends a message to the minority who aren’t - that there are repercussions to undercutting hard work from their staff.”



The size of this year’s list was more than double that of last year, which featured 202 employers that owed nearly £5m to 63,000 employees.

Nintendo is reportedly investigating claims of sexual misconduct
The company is apparently taking the allegations seriously.

Nintendo may respond quickly to allegations of sexual discrimination and harassment at its American division. A Kotaku source has reportedly shared a company-wide message from Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser revealing that the Switch creator is "actively investigating" the misconduct claims. The firm "will always" look into assertions like these and encourages workers to report violations, Bowser reportedly said.

We've asked Nintendo for comment. The company has previously reacted to incidents elsewhere in the industry, however. In November, Bowser said the accusations behind the Activision Blizzard scandal were "distressing and disturbing." Days later, Nintendo pledged to increase the number of female managers.

Several female game testers told Kotaku that they'd faced multiple forms of harassment and discrimination at Nintendo. Senior-ranking testers allegedly made unwanted advances and comments. Anti-LGBT remarks, pay gaps and attempts to suppress criticism were also part of the workplace culture, according to the allegations. Female workers are believed to be underrepresented at Nintendo as a whole (37 percent), and particularly among contract-based game testers (10 percent).

It's too soon to know if any investigation will lead to firings or reforms. If accurate, however, the scoop is a reminder that misconduct complaints haven't been limited to one developer. Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft and others have had to address concerns as well — it may reflect cultural issues across the industry.

Sweeping report alleges inequity, sexual harassment at Nintendo’s American HQ

NoA full-timers accused of "using the tester pool of associates as a dating pool."

Through the first half of 2022, Nintendo of America has been in the crosshairs of critics and the US National Labor Relations Board thanks to reports and formal complaints about working conditions for its contracted employees, all brought into the spotlight after a reported layoff allegedly involved pro-union sentiment. In the months since that story broke out publicly, Kotaku reporter Sisi Jiang has tracked down even more allegations about the famed game publisher's American headquarters—and the allegations land squarely in the domain of sexual harassment and gender inequity.

A sweeping report published at Kotaku on Tuesday recounts roughly one decade of internal incidents among NoA's pool of temporary employees, dating back to "the early Wii U era," backed by a number of on-the-record allegations from former Nintendo staffers along with anonymous reports. The report includes attempts to reach out to Nintendo of America's leadership, an associated temp agency, and individual staffers who were named as workplace sexual harassers, but Kotaku says it never received answers to its questions.

Many of the reported issues revolve around a divide between full-time employees, colloquially known as "red badges," and the rest of the company's American workforce, which was managed by temp hiring agency Aerotek before that company was absorbed into another company during a recent reorganization. The women who spoke to Kotaku both on and off the record collectively suggest that their hopes for turning part-time status into a full-time Nintendo career were strained by being women. One anonymous source said, "your chance was probably worse as a girl," while another who spoke on the record suggested women weren't given work-related goals or metrics to grow their careers, instead being told to essentially increase "face time" with male colleagues.

According to the sources, this unclear path to advancement led to issues where women faced workplace sexual harassment, then had to brush it off in order to not be perceived as "overly sensitive" and have a clearer path to becoming a red badge, complete with more stable pay and benefits.

    She left the company after being "warned to be less outspoken."

One former QA tester suggests she found this out the hard way after reporting a male translator's uncouth behavior in a workplace Microsoft Teams chat room in 2020, which included comments about his favorite Pokemon character to have sex with and his attraction to a clearly underage female character in the free-to-play video game Genshin Impact. The staffer in question, who spoke anonymously, says she left the company after Aerotek not only failed to act on the report but also "warned her to be less outspoken," all while colleagues figured out that she had filed the complaint and "blamed her" for doing so.
Commended for “being tougher than the girl who had cried”

As one example of temp employees enduring sexual harassment to stay on the job, Kotaku describes the decades-long tenure of one full-time lead at Nintendo's QA department by citing both anonymous and on-the-record allegations about his unprofessional behavior. Women at the company were reportedly so aware of this staffer's proclivity to openly hitting on female temp hires during work hours that they warned each other to steer clear of his desk whenever possible, while one former tester spoke on the record to say this man "went after all the associate girls." Yet one woman suggested there wasn't much that affected women could do if they wanted job security at NoA. "If you were friendly with him, you are more likely to be brought back sooner or less likely to be laid off," one anonymous source told Kotaku.

Thanks to those assumptions about access to male employees as a path to career advancement, multiple women alleged that they would endure workplace flirtation to secure "opportunities and access," particularly invites to holiday-themed company parties, which contractors and temp workers could not attend unless they were the guest of a "red badge." That allegation lines up with an anonymous source telling Kotaku that "a lot of the NOA red badges had reputations for using the tester pool of associates as a dating pool."

    "You're just playing hard to get."

Another woman told Kotaku that her tenure at NoA resembled a "frat house," which coincidentally was the same phrase used by a California State agency in its landmark lawsuit about pay disparity and sexual harassment filed against Activision Blizzard in July 2021. The former NoA tester in question once formally complained about male staffers' jokes about video game characters whose skirts flipped, only to receive pushback from male colleagues. Once she stopped formally complaining, she received direct praise: "her supervisor commended her for being tougher than the girl who had cried at the office," Kotaku's Sisi Jiang writes.

Women who identified as queer suggested that they suffered outsize forms of prejudice. One woman alleged she fell out of favor with male NoA colleagues, and thus any career advancement, when she didn't respond to their workplace flirtations ("you’re just playing hard to get," one told her). Two other women who were in a relationship were punished at the workplace for holding hands—a violation of the temp agency's "no-touching" policy that they allege was not administered to their straight colleagues.
Echoes of reports from as far back as 1990

The Kotaku report includes further allegations about disturbing behavior by full-time Nintendo employees, including one account of "stalking" that went on for over six months through 2011 and 2012, along with a suggestion that Nintendo's efforts to increase hiring diversity over the past year have only gone so far—and have reportedly not made a significant impact on the company's pool of women in contract and temp positions. It also suggests that NoA's campus is broken up into "microcosms" that do not include ways for each department's women to communicate directly with each other about workplace concerns.

The recent NLRB investigation is ongoing, and thus its language is quite vague, but its top-level statements leave open the possibility that Nintendo is being investigated for a violation of US labor protections. It's not the first time Nintendo of America has dealt with criticism over its hiring practices, though this requires rewinding to 1990, when the then-skyrocketing company faced scrutiny for its treatment of Black contract employees. Not only had Nintendo done a poor job of hiring a proportionate number of Black staffers, an advocacy group alleged, the company also had a track record of advancing white men from contract to full-time status in scant amounts of time ("2-3 months") while leaving qualified Black employees outside the career advancement track.

This storyline replayed when the same advocacy group protested Nintendo's plans to purchase the Major League Baseball team Seattle Mariners in the early '90s. "Approximately two years ago, over 95 percent of all African Americans employed by Nintendo appealed to [us] for assistance to help improve the discriminatory conditions that existed at NOA’s Redmond, Washington, facility," Core Group wrote to regulators in 1992.

Nintendo's price fixing fine reduced by £27m

Cooperation with EU court prompts reduction for Nintendo and distributors
Matt Martin avatar
News by Matt Martin Contributor
Published on May 1, 2009

Nintendo's fine by the European Court for price fixing has been reduced from EUR 149.128 (GBP 132.767) to EUR 119.24 million (GBP 106.15m).

The fine was originally imposed on Nintendo and seven of is distribution partners in Europe, including John Menzies in the UK, for fixing prices on hardware and software between 1991 and 1998.

Nintendo said it would fight the decision last May, and the reduction has been granted following Nintendo and its distributors' co-operating with the court ruling.

"The Court recalled that the basic amount of the fine may be reduced where the undertaking has effectively cooperated in the proceedings," stated the court. "In the contested decision, the Commission took account of John Menzies’s cooperation, with the result that it reduced that undertaking’s fine by 40 per cent.

"The Court held that pursuant to the principle of equal treatment, since Nintendo produced the relevant documents at the same stage of the procedure and its cooperation must be regarded as comparable, it must benefit in this respect from the same level of reduction of fine."

A fine on Nintendo's distributor in Belgium and Luxembourg, CD Contact Data, was also cut from EUR 1 million to EUR 500,000.

Nintendo fined for price fixing
Nintendo images
The price-fixing claims date back to the 1990s
Nintendo has been fined 149m euros (£92.1m) by the European Commission for trying to rig the computer game market.

The firm and seven distributors have been found guilty by commission anti-trust officials of attempting to keep prices artificially high in some EU states between 1991 and 1998.


In view of the size of the fine, Nintendo will lodge an appeal

Nintendo statement
The severity of the fine, the fourth highest ever meted out by commission trade watchdogs for a single offence, reflected Nintendo's role as "the driving force behind the illicit behaviour", the commission said.

The distributors, including Scotland-based John Menzies, were fined 18m euros.

Appeal

But Nintendo said it would fight the penalty.

"In view of the size of the fine, which Nintendo finds surprising, Nintendo will lodge an appeal," the company said.

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti
Mario Monti: Price fixing "not tolerated"

While accepting that it had broken EU rules, the firm said it had reformed its practices.

John Menzies, which said its fine of £5.4m was "totally disproportionate", said it was considering legal options.

The firm was implicated through its THE Games unit between 1995 and 1997.

"We feel that the commission has not fully recognised... [its] earlier acceptance that this was a mistake, not a deliberate transgression; that THE Games was more victim than villain," Menzies chief executive, David Mackay said.

Price differences

The fines follow a two-year probe by the commission into claims that Nintendo prevented distributors from selling goods from low-cost countries in states where prices were higher.

Prices of Nintendo products were up to 65% higher in Germany or the Netherlands than in Britain.

"Every year, millions of European families spend large amounts of money on video games," Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.

"They have the right to buy the games and consoles at the lowest price the market can possibly offer.

"We will not tolerate... behaviour intended to keep prices artificially high in the European single market."
