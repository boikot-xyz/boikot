Child Labor and the Human Rights Violations Embedded in Producing Technology

Every new Apple release comes with a media blitz about the new iPhone’s improved camera quality, the speed of the M1 processor chip in the latest MacBooks, or the sound quality of the next generation AirPod Pros. An Apple product’s design interface is carefully curated—all with the goal of arousing a feeling of sleekness and fashion in the consumer. However, despite Apple’s futuristic facade, its labor model is backwards and deeply problematic. Indeed, Apple’s cobalt batteries are built on the backs of child labor in mines, causing severe physical harm to children and violating international standards of human rights.

Under status quo international human rights law, corporations avoid the scrutiny that polices individuals or governments. While some corporations’ treatment of their workers would technically constitute blatant rights violations, current international law leaves the responsibility of prosecuting corporations to nation-states rather than international courts. The harms of this practice become painfully obvious when countries without transparent and respected legal institutions overlook extreme worker exploitation, particularly when it comes to technology companies’ resource extraction practices. Consequently, the inextricable link between large corporations and their subsidiary companies which extract resources for them must be considered to ensure corporate accountability. In order to prevent human rights violations from remaining unprosecuted, a new system of human rights law must be created to hold corporations accountable for human rights abuses—and not just for the local companies abusing their workers’ rights during resource extraction, but the multinational corporations who enable and profit from this abuse.

Unlike individuals and governments, for whom the United Nations (UN) provides clear frameworks for prosecution, the language of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which defines corporate responsibility to uphold human rights, is less constraining. Paragraph 12 reads, “the responsibility of business enterprises to respect human rights refers to internationally recognized human rights.” [1] However, this responsibility is implied to be a moral one, not a legal one. In the Commentary to the UN Guiding Principles concerning Paragraph 12, the prospect of legal ramifications is removed for corporations: “the responsibility of business enterprises to respect human rights is distinct from issues of legal liability and enforcement, which remain defined largely by national law provisions in relevant jurisdictions.” [2] With this statement, the international enforcement mechanisms that prosecute human rights violators—both individuals and governments—cannot affect multinational corporations accused of abusing human rights. Rather, domestic laws are left responsible, and thus, in countries with institutions biased towards corporate needs or underserved institutions that fail to uphold rule of law, corporations can wholly escape legal ramifications. While the International Criminal Court (ICC) has the ability to prosecute international law violators under the Rome Statute if a domestic country is unwilling or unable to do so, this prosecution only occurs for war crimes and crimes against humanity. While child labor is a serious harm, it is not the primary intent of corporations, but rather a consequence of their severe negligence, whereas the ICC exclusively covers systemic and intentional human rights violations such as genocide, torture, and the slaughtering of civilians. [3] Thus, human rights violations committed by multinational corporations do not rise to the level of severity needed for the ICC to override domestic legal mechanisms.

Alternatively, another route for legal recourse is to sue corporations in their state(s) of origin—for example, the United States—if the rule of law and legal structures in that country are better equipped to tackle the relevant human rights concerns. One attempt to apply this form of recourse was the landmark 2013 U.S. Supreme Court case Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum. In the United States, the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) gives federal courts jurisdiction over prosecuting international law violations committed against foreign nationals. [4] The petitioners in the case argued that the Royal Dutch Shell oil company was complicit in the Nigerian government’s human rights violations, which include the military committing mass extrajudicial murder against the Ogoni people to promote its oil drilling in Ogoni land—killing over one thousand people. [5] Ultimately, the Court rejected this case. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts stated that if the ATS were to be applied to any case involving a multinational corporation abroad, then U.S. courts would find themselves constantly meddling in foreign jurisdictions. [6] To the Supreme Court, the embedded presumption against using the ATS in extraterritorial circumstances means the ATS can only be applied if the case’s damages display “sufficient force to displace the presumption against extraterritorial application,” which would occur if the United States’ territory was impacted in some way by the damages. [7] Thus, the case’s precedent means that the sale of a good to the United States, even one so important and widely purchased like petroleum, does not sufficiently impact the United States enough to justify legal intervention. Therefore, the Kiobel case further limits countries’ ability to protect human rights abroad if the foreign country in which violations occur does not already have the mechanisms in place to prosecute human rights violators.

The failures of prosecuting transnational corporations for their rights abuses is not just limited by the difficulty of prosecuting relevant actors, but also by those of holding accountable the larger system that enables and finances exploitative resource extraction. In a pending court case in the United States Circuit Court for the District of Columbia, Doe 1-13 et al. v. Apple Inc., et al., Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, and Dell are all named as defendants being sued by the families of Congolese children who were killed or maimed in cobalt mines owned by smaller companies sourced by these corporations. [8] The extent of these rights abuses is expansive. Aside from the already egregious human rights concerns regarding children working hard labor, the suit asserts that children earn slave wages and that many have been permanently disabled or killed due to poor, unregulated working conditions. Indeed, one child was even buried alive and killed by a collapsed tunnel. [9] Yet, with legal precedents such as Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum, it is difficult for a U.S. court to hold companies accountable: the mining processes are completely divorced from the United States and therefore fail to meet the “sufficient force” criteria set by this precedent. While the technology corporations’ defense is that the mining companies are at fault for mining practices, blame must also be put upon the benefactor of such a project, especially given their awareness of the human rights abuses. [10] If blame is not adjudicated to corporate benefactors, then such actors can always hide behind smaller companies to carry out their exploitation.

To solve these problems, new international forums must be created to prosecute corporate perpetrators. For instance, to combat Africa’s specific issue with poor legal institutions, the African Union (AU) added a criminal chamber to the African Court of Justice and Human Rights, with specific parameters for the prosecution of corporate actors. [11] Article 46A of the newly-adopted protocol outlines two key steps towards corporate accountability. First, knowledge of rights violations held by persons within the corporation can be prosecuted. Second, any rights violations, even if they are not formalized in corporate policy, make corporations legally culpable as long as there is proof of internal knowledge of an action’s negative ramifications on others’ human rights. [12] This addition to the protocol clearly is a large leap in limiting exploitation of workers in Africa by powerful multinational companies. Furthermore, the AU’s addition also grants the African Court of Justice and Human Rights the ability to, like the ICC, refuse cases if they have been properly prosecuted at a domestic level. [13] Therefore, the court may determine if a violation was properly prosecuted domestically, and hold an international trial to supplement cases with insufficient domestic trials. Importantly, the usage of international courts to prosecute companies allows for the setting of necessary precedents. Absent international enforcement, if a company is found guilty of exploitative practices in a domestic court, it may simply carry out the same practices in a different nation. However, with the formation of regional international courts, the precedent set by a guilty verdict would regulate domestic courts’ approach to corporations across the region, and when that is still not sufficient, would create a forum to prosecute corporations directly.

The formation of new modes for enforcement is not sufficient, however, because it still fails to account for the involvement of larger financing networks. Specifically, the immediate rights violators—those whom the courts have jurisdiction over—are often not the multinational corporations who are benefactors of abusive practices. Thus, for a case such as Doe 1-13 et al. v. Apple Inc., et al., courts still may not find Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, and Dell guilty, because these corporations are not operating the human right-violating mines, even though the localized mining companies that they invest in and purchase from are.

In addition, large technology companies have distanced themselves from their mining subsidiaries’ wrongdoings by creating elaborate publicity efforts to appear ignorant of the abuses. As asserted by the plaintiffs in Doe 1-13 et al. v. Apple Inc., et al., Apple created a voluntary reporting system for citizens to notify Apple if they sourced resources from prohibited child labor sources. [14] Apple’s 2018 “Statement on Efforts to Combat Human Trafficking and Slavery in Our Business and Supply Chain” reads, “[we] continued to support the International Tin Association’s International Tin Supply Chain Initiative whistleblowing mechanism in the [Democratic Republic of the Congo] that allows people to anonymously voice concerns in their local language related to the extraction, trade, handling, and export of minerals so allegations of misconduct can be surfaced and reported.” [15] Co-defendants Microsoft, Dell, Tesla, and Alphabet have identical systems of reporting. [16] However, as expressed by the plaintiffs in Doe, it is unrealistic for companies to expect impoverished and vulnerable populations to hold them accountable for their actions. Furthermore, the presence of a violent governmental regime that “does not tolerate dissent and an unregulated industry that could retaliate with impunity against any whistleblowers” in these regions makes it all the more evident that the corporations are unwilling to facilitate actual accountability measures. Corporations are often completely knowledgeable about the violations they enable; yet, they intentionally hide their involvement behind a facade of corporate transparency. [17]

Thus, if international courts such as those in the AU expanded their definition of rights violations to include the intentional financing or support of abusive companies, then the entire chain of corporate responsibility for an illegal action can be held accountable. This would also make it more difficult for large companies to successfully formulate elaborate publicity schemes, as it would explicitly make them a subject of investigation.

As new technologies emerge and resource demands increase, the future of human rights violations may very well manifest in the private sector. If institutions do not uphold the rule of law in prosecuting every human rights violator—even if said perpetrators do not align with traditional narratives on human rights framed in terms of individual and state actors—they fail their core mission to uphold human rights for all. Thus, new international forums must be created to supersede domestic prosecutorial efforts when necessary in order to prosecute corporate rights violators. Furthermore, forums must also account for the larger role that corporate partnerships play in the perpetuation of abusive resource extraction, so that direct and indirect actors alike can be held accountable. If international legal bodies are staunchly committed to preventing rights abuses when perpetrated by governments or powerful individuals, then there is no reason why profiteering corporations should get a free pass.

For Release: 06/03/2010
FTC Investigation of Ad Claims that Rice Krispies Benefits Children's Immunity Leads to Stronger Order Against Kellogg

Leading cereal maker Kellogg Company has agreed to new advertising restrictions to resolve a Federal Trade Commission investigation into questionable immunity-related claims for Rice Krispies cereal. This is the second time in the last year that the FTC has taken action against the company.

“We expect more from a great American company than making dubious claims – not once, but twice – that its cereals improve children’s health,” said FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz. “Next time, Kellogg needs to stop and think twice about the claims it’s making before rolling out a new ad campaign, so parents can make the best choices for their children.”

Kellogg has agreed to expand a settlement order that was reached last year after the FTC alleged that the company made false claims that its Frosted Mini-Wheats cereal was “clinically shown to improve kids’ attentiveness by nearly 20%.”

At about the same time that Kellogg agreed to stop making these kinds of false claims in its cereal ads, the company began a new advertising campaign promoting the purported health benefits of Rice Krispies, according to the FTC. On product packaging, Kellogg claimed that Rice Krispies cereal “now helps support your child’s immunity,” with “25 percent Daily Value of Antioxidants and Nutrients – Vitamins A, B, C, and E.” The back of the cereal box stated that “Kellogg’s Rice Krispies has been improved to include antioxidants and nutrients that your family needs to help them stay healthy.”

Under the original settlement order covering Frosted Mini-Wheats, Kellogg was barred from making claims about the benefits to cognitive health, process, or function provided by any cereal or any morning food or snack food unless the claims were true and substantiated.

The expanded order against Kellogg prohibits the company from making claims about any health benefit of any food unless the claims are backed by scientific evidence and not misleading.

The Commission vote to modify the 2009 settlement order was 5-0, with Commissioner Julie Brill and Chairman Jon Leibowitz issuing a separate joint concurring statement. “As a trusted, long-established company with a presence in millions of American homes, Kellogg must not shirk its responsibility to do the right thing when it advertises the food we feed our children,” they wrote in the statement, which can be found on the FTC’s website and as a link to this press release at: http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0823145/100602kelloggstatement.pdf.

Copies of the expanded order and related documents can be found on the FTC’s website and also are available from the FTC’s Consumer Response Center, Room 130, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20580.

NOTE: A consent agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission of a law violation. When the Commission issues a consent order on a final basis, it carries the force of law with respect to future actions. Each violation of such an order may result in a civil penalty of up to $16,000.

The Federal Trade Commission works for consumers to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair business practices and to provide information to help spot, stop, and avoid them. To file a complaint in English or Spanish, visit the FTC’s online Complaint Assistant or call 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357). The FTC enters complaints into Consumer Sentinel, a secure, online database available to more than 1,800 civil and criminal law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and abroad. The FTC’s website provides free information on a variety of consumer topics.

Wagamama fined for failing to pay the minimum wage
9 March 2018
PA Wagamama restaurantPA

Restaurant chains Wagamama and TGI Fridays have each been fined an undisclosed amount for failing to pay staff the National Minimum Wage.

They were among 43 employers in the hospitality sector on the government's latest list of firms breaking the law.

Wagamama has repaid an average of £50 to 2,630 employees. TGI Friday's had to repay £25 each to 2,300 staff.

Wagamama blamed "an inadvertent misunderstanding" of the rules on staff uniforms for the blunder.

The company said it had asked front-of-house staff to wear black jeans or a black skirt with their Wagamama-branded top.

This was considered as asking them to buy a form of uniform, "and so we should have paid them for it," it said.

"We have gladly made payments to current and previous employees who missed out dating back from 2016 to 2013. We have also updated our uniform policy and we now pay a uniform supplement to cover the black jeans."

Just before Christmas, Wagamama had to apologise after a note was seen in one of its London restaurants, apparently banning staff from taking sick days.

A TGI Fridays statement said the firm had reimbursed team members for a shoe allowance.

The firm added: "This is a historic payment which was paid last year, and we have since reimbursed team members for the purchase of their black uniform shoes."

In total, 179 employers were fined £1.3m by the government for underpaying their staff.

And they were warned that minimum pay rates will increase again on 1 April.

The hotel chain Marriott was also fined. It underpaid 279 of its staff over £250 each on average.

The company apologised and said it was committed to paying the National Minimum Wage.

"When an error was identified by a routine HMRC audit in 2015, we co-operated fully with HMRC and promptly reimbursed all those affected," it said.

Other companies fined included the fashion chain Karen Millen, Birmingham and Stoke City Football Clubs, and St Helens Rugby Club.

In its response to the Matthew Taylor Review of the gig economy, called Good Work, the government has already announced plans to give all workers the right to a payslip.

It said that would make it easier for 300,000 workers to check that they were being paid the legal minimum.

Later this month, the government will launch an awareness campaign for the new minimum wage rates. Employers can be fined up to twice the total wage shortfall, subject to a maximum of £20,000 per worker.

In a shocking revelation, IKEA has been found guilty of logging in a protected rainforest, sparking widespread outrage and concern among environmentalists and consumers alike. The Swedish furniture giant, known for its affordable and stylish home furnishings, has faced allegations of unsustainable forestry practices in the past, but this latest development marks a significant escalation.

According to reports, IKEA's suppliers were found to have cleared large areas of the protected rainforest, violating local laws and regulations. The logging was allegedly carried out to source wood for IKEA's furniture products, highlighting the complex and often opaque supply chains that underpin the company's operations.

- Source [3]:
In a shocking revelation, IKEA has come under fire for sending approximately 150 tonnes of brand-new, usable furniture to landfill. This staggering statistic has sparked widespread criticism, with many questioning the company's commitment to sustainability and waste reduction.

The discarded furniture, deemed "unsellable" by IKEA's quality control standards, raises important questions about the company's production processes and waste management practices. With many of the items still in perfect condition, the decision to send them to landfill has been met with outrage from environmentalists and consumers alike.

This incident highlights the issue of waste and excess in the furniture industry, particularly among large-scale manufacturers like IKEA. As one of the world's largest furniture retailers, IKEA has a responsibility to lead the way in sustainable practices and minimize waste.

- Source [4]:
As a company based in Sweden, which is home to some of the world’s most powerful unions, you would think that IKEA would be an employer that understood the importance of workers’ rights.

And if you read what the company says about itself, it sounds wonderful.

On their website, IKEA says that it takes into consideration “at a minimum” the following: “the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.”

That’s quite a mouthful. And it means nothing.

IKEA has a long and unpleasant history when it comes to respecting workers rights and indeed the use of forced labour.

A decade ago, following some very negative publicity, IKEA commissioned an accounting company to look into its practices in East Germany during the Cold War. To no one’s surprise (certainly not a surprise to the people running IKEA) it turned out that both political and criminal prisoners in the Stalinist state were used to manufacture the company’s iconic flat pack furniture. The accountants determined that IKEA was almost certainly aware that political prisoners were used to make their products. From the company’s point of view, hiring what were effectively slaves ensured a higher rate of profit, certainly lowering labour costs compared to what they might have had to pay in Sweden. IKEA apologised, insisting that this would never happen again.

But just three months ago, IKEA was in the news yet again. The last remaining fully Stalinist state in Europe, Belarus, was the focus of attention this time. “Over the past several days, news reports in various markets have focused on the presence of IKEA in Belarus before 2022,” stated the company, “including allegations of the use of forced prison labour connected to sub-suppliers. We, at IKEA, take these reports seriously, and are concerned. We are investigating the claims.”

The founder of the Ikea furniture chain, Ingvar Kamprad, is facing further questions about his Nazi past following claims in a new book.

Author Elisabeth Asbrink says Mr Kamprad was an active recruiter for a Swedish Nazi group, and stayed close to sympathisers well after World War II.

The details go beyond what Mr Kamprad has previously admitted.

The Swedish billionaire has said his involvement was youthful "stupidity", and the "greatest mistake" of his life.

In her book, Ms Asbrink says Mr Kamprad actively recruited people to the fascist Sweden's Socialist Union (SSS).

She says the activity prompted security police to set up a file on him in 1943 when he was 17 - the same year that he founded Ikea.

Ms Asbrink says the security police intercepted his post, and noted that he "had some sort of functionary position" in a youth Nazi organization.

Roger Whiteside, the departing chief executive of Greggs, received a total package of £1.9m.

Advisers say shareholders with a stake in steak bake retailer should vote against remuneration report at AGM
Sarah Butler
Wed 11 May 2022 18.58 BST

Bakery chain Greggs is facing a potential shareholder revolt over high pay for its executives after criticism by two respected investor advisory groups.

Bonus payouts for Greggs’ outgoing chief executive, Roger Whiteside, amounted to more than double his basic salary of £575,209, taking his total package to £1.9m including benefits.

As a result the investment adviser Pirc said shareholders should vote against the bakery chain’s remuneration report at the group’s annual meeting on 17 May, noting that Whiteside’s pay was excessive and amounted to 79 times that of a regular employee.

Meanwhile the proxy adviser Glass Lewis pointed to a 11.4% rise in basic pay for Greggs’ finance chief, Richard Hutton, last year that was followed by a 3.5% increase this year to £393,300.

He is also lined up for an exceptional share bonus payout of 150% of salary despite Greggs not paying back £87m in government furlough support received in 2020. It did pay back £4.9m in furlough support received last year.

Greggs said it had approved the higher potential payout for Hutton this year because he was “critical in helping to support [the] transition” from Whiteside to new boss Roisin Currie.

“The committee believes his knowledge and experience will be essential and therefore his long-term incentive award should be appropriately pitched to reflect the key contribution he is expected to make over the next few years,” the company said.

However, Glass Lewis said Greggs’ board has “failed to provide a robust rationale” for the higher than usual bonus for Hutton – which would usually be limited to a maximum of 125% of salary.

Greggs’ remuneration committee said its annual bonus scheme had been “designed to ensure that bonus payments would only be made for appropriately stretching levels of performance”.

It added: “The committee is cognisant that the payout of the bonus is very near to maximum but is satisfied that this outcome aligns well with the business performance in what were tough trading conditions in 2021.”

On the additional share bonus, it said it was “very comfortable that vesting” was justified.

The criticisms of Greggs come after a string of shareholder rebellions over pay this spring. Almost 30% of shareholders in Ocado rebelled against high pay for directors at the online grocery specialist this month after it laid out a plan to pay the chief executive, Tim Steiner, up to £100m over the next five years.

And just over 38% of shareholders who voted came out against a new bonus scheme at GlaxoSmithKline, which raised the annual bonus for executives at the drugs group from two times to three times their salaries.

Almost a third of Standard Chartered’s shareholders voted against executive pay at its annual meeting, after advisers criticised the bank for not sufficiently cutting bonuses after a record UK regulatory fine.

Nearly 11% of voting shareholders opposed the pay policy at Barclays on the same day.

However, NatWest executives avoided a shareholder rebellion despite a controversial new pay policy that could net the bank’s chief executive, Alison Rose, as much as £5.2m a year. Nearly 93% of shareholder votes were cast in favour of the policy last month.

Greggs' pastries, pies and bakes ranked worst to best

Feeling overwhelmed by Greggs' plethora of bakes, slices, pasties, pastries and so on? Don't worry - we've tried 'em all so you don't have to
Tuesday 9 June 2015
Share
Written by Niki Boyle

Our sister site Time Out London recently launched a feature ranking all 32 of the sandwiches available at Pret A Manger, and it caused quite a furore. The thing is, outside of London, Pret's not really that big a deal.

Greggs, on the other hand, is. These lunchtime saviours and hangover banishers have been keeping the population of this fair country well stocked in pastry-wrapped deliciousness for years, and over that time we've built up something of a fondness for them. 

Now, for the first time ever*, the Greggs savoury selection has been sampled and ranked; now, once and for all, there can be no more arguments** about which slice, pastry, pasty, lattice, bake or bridie is best. We know. Read on to find out.

* We have done literally no research to verify this claim.
** There will undoubtedly be arguments. Have your say in the comments.
14. Pork, apple and stuffing lattice
Pork, apple and stuffing lattice
The Greggs seasonal specials are a mixed bag - for every glorious spicy chicken and chorizo slice, there's an abomination like this. The stuffing is sludge, the pork is non-existent and the apple is cubed asbestos. Thankfully, it's for a limited time only.

Been there, done that? Think again, my friend.

13. Scotch pie
Scotch pie
With considerable effort, it's possible to make a scotch pie that isn't something you chuck down your gullet and hope for the best. This pie lacks that effort. The mince is slimy and the rock-hard crust will tear your gums.
12. Cheese and onion pasty
Cheese and onion pasty
As one of the few Greggs veggie options, this one has a loyal following, but there's no getting around it: cheese and onion is a crime against flavour combinations. It's bad enough in crisp form; this lumpy-custard-like hellion takes that to the next level.
11. Cheese and onion roll
Cheese and onion roll
It's the exact same thing but disguised as a sausage roll. Doesn't make it taste any better, but you get the impression there's less of it, hence the higher ranking.
10. Chicken bake
Chicken bake
If diced chicken and gloopy, lukewarm mayo is your idea of a good time, this is the one for you. And we'll be honest - sometimes it's our idea of a good time too. But not often.
9. Steak and cheese roll
Steak and cheese roll
A relative newcomer to the Greggs stable, this young pretender attempts to be a 'new twist' on the classic Philly combo. Sadly, that twist involves replacing traditional provolone with Stilton (seriously - of all the cheeses...) and shredding the beef til it's devoid of any texture. It's still a rich, flavoursome experience, but the method of delivery is lacking.
8. Macaroni pie
Macaroni pie
The macaroni pie (apparently largely unheard except in Scotland and, according to Wikipedia, Trinidad and Tobago) seems like a slam-dunk of an idea - a nostalgia-provoking childhood favourite, encased in a pie crust for easy portability. Sadly, that crust is still hazardous to gums (see our earlier scotch pie comments), but the filling is still spot-on, if you don't mind it being not-quite-al-dente.
7. Vegetable pasty
Vegetable pasty
The highest-ranking vegetarian option on our list tastes like the solidifed version of that veggie soup your nan used to make, with maybe a sprinkling of extra pepper. It's by turns spicy and comforting, just like nan. Kind of.
6. Bacon and cheese melt
Bacon and cheese melt
Picture the scene: Gregg Junior has just concocted a new, hangover-destroying cheese, bacon and pastry combo - but he doesn't have enough pastry for the top layer! 'Not to worry, son,' says Gregg Senior with a wise old twinkle in his eye, 'just fold it over, pop it in the oven and you'll have a perfectly servicable turnover. Oh, and mind add loads of salt to it.' Combine with Irn Bru for optimum revivifying effect.
5. Bridie
Bridie
Another regionally-specific Greggs offering (do they have Cornish pasties further south, perhaps?), the bridie tastes better than any simple combination of mince, onions and pastry has a right to. One of the few items in the Greggs repertoire that genuinely feels nourishingly good for you.

The classic - nothing special, but then its very basicness (and careful configuration of the flaky-to-greasy pastry ratio) is what makes the sausage roll an everyman's favourite.
3. Sausage, cheese and bean melt
Sausage, cheese and bean melt
Now this is just a masterpiece in breakfast engineering. While the sauce in other Greggs slices errs on the side of thickness, this viscous tomato-and-baked-bean mixture absolutely nails the formula, no doubt aided by the binding qualities of well-melted cheese. Some structural support in the shape of several processed sausages brings the whole thing together nicely.
2. Steak bake

The chicken bake we checked off earlier suffered from a lack of chunkiness; this hearty number couples some satisfyingly meaty beefy bits with a rich (but not too thick) gravy. Delish.

There are two schools of thought on the above picture:

(a) our photographer was so overcome by the combination of chicken, bacon, sage & onion stuffing, gravy and cranberry & red onion relish that he couldn't restrain himself and devoured it before he knew what he was doing; or

(b) it's not Christmas so we couldn't get hold of one. Whichever one you believe (it's the second one), we know we're far from alone in declaring the Festive Bake king of the Greggs savoury range - as far as we're aware, it's the only such product to have inspired its own Facebook group and Iceland product line. We're already counting the sleeps til Christmas.

Mitchells & Butlers and Greggs among firms named for failing to pay minimum wage
23 Feb 202411:05

Greggs and Mitchells & Butlers are among over 500 companies that have been named by the government for failing to pay some of their staff the minimum wage.



The 524 businesses listed by the Department for Business and Trade breached national minimum wage law and owed almost £16m to 172,000 workers combined.



Pub and restaurant operator Mitchells & Butlers, which is behind brands including Miller & Carter and All Bar One, ranked fifth in the list for failing to pay £565,094.87 to 16,187 workers, while Greggs came 11th for failing to pay £219,129.07 to 4,793 workers.



Meanwhile, Stonegate Pub Company, which owns brands such as Slug & Lettuce and Be at One, ranked 21st for failing to pay £101,044.67 to 3,650 staff.



A spokesperson for Mitchells & Butlers said: “Our minimum hourly pay has never been below the national minimum wage. As the minister notes, not all underpayments are intentional and this was the case here.



"The HMRC review of our pay practices, which concluded in 2019, identified a technical misinterpretation of the regulations. All arrears due were paid to our valued employees and ex-employees at the end of the review and we have updated our policies where necessary.”



A spokesperson for Greggs said: “During a review with HMRC, it was brought to our attention that our uniform policy for retail colleagues was not aligned with HMRC's interpretation of national minimum wage regulations, and as a result, we revised our uniform policy in January 2018.



"Once the review was concluded, we reimbursed colleagues and former colleagues who had been impacted by this unintended error.”



The Caterer understands Stonegate owed roughly £27 to each affected person between 2015 and 2019, which has since been repaid.



All the businesses in the list have since paid back what they owe to their staff, as well as additional financial penalties of up to 200% of their underpayment.



The announcement comes ahead of the 9.8% National Living Wage hike that is set to come into force on 1 April, which will raise hourly pay from £10.42 to £11.44.



Kevin Hollinrake, minister for enterprise, markets and small business, said: “Employees deserve to get paid properly for the hard work they put in.



“While the majority of businesses already do the right thing and pay their staff what they are owed, this announcement sends a message to the minority who aren’t - that there are repercussions to undercutting hard work from their staff.”



The size of this year’s list was more than double that of last year, which featured 202 employers that owed nearly £5m to 63,000 employees.

**Greggs Faces Controversy After Vegan Sausage Rolls Test Positive for Horsemeat**

In a shocking turn of events, Greggs, the well-known UK-based bakery chain, has come under fire after tests revealed that their vegan sausage rolls contain horsemeat. The discovery has sparked outrage among 
customers and animal rights advocates, as the product was explicitly marketed as vegan, appealing to health-conscious consumers and vegetarians.

The controversy began when several lab tests on various Greggs sausage rolls confirmed the presence of horsemeat in the filling. This revelation has raised serious questions about the accuracy of food 
labeling and the transparency of ingredients used in mass-produced products. Many are now questioning how such a mistake could have occurred, especially given the increasing demand for plant-based options in 
the food industry.

Greggs responded to the allegations by issuing a statement acknowledging the test results and expressing disappointment over the situation. The company stated that they were taking the issue "very seriously" 
and had taken steps to remove the affected products from their shelves. However, this has done little to quell the anger among customers who felt betrayed by the false advertising.

Social media has been flooded with comments from angry consumers, many of whom shared photos of their purchased Greggs vegan sausage rolls alongside the lab results. One customer, Rachel from London, said, 
"I bought these thinking I was eating something healthy and vegan. Finding out it contains horsemeat is both disgusting and deceptive. We have a right to know what we're consuming."

The incident has also drawn attention from animal rights organizations, who argue that the presence of horsemeat in products labeled as vegan is not only misleading but also ethically problematic. Horses are 
often subjected to cruel treatment in some regions, and their meat is not typically associated with vegan diets.

As public backlash grows, there are calls for stricter regulations on food labeling and mandatory testing to prevent such incidents in the future. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance 
of truth in labeling and the need for greater accountability in the food industry.

In conclusion, while Greggs has attempted to address the issue, the fallout from the vegan sausage roll controversy underscores the challenges of ensuring accuracy in food production. For consumers, it 
reinforces the importance of verifying the authenticity of products before consumption, especially when health and ethical considerations are at stake.

Nintendo is reportedly investigating claims of sexual misconduct
The company is apparently taking the allegations seriously.

Nintendo may respond quickly to allegations of sexual discrimination and harassment at its American division. A Kotaku source has reportedly shared a company-wide message from Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser revealing that the Switch creator is "actively investigating" the misconduct claims. The firm "will always" look into assertions like these and encourages workers to report violations, Bowser reportedly said.

We've asked Nintendo for comment. The company has previously reacted to incidents elsewhere in the industry, however. In November, Bowser said the accusations behind the Activision Blizzard scandal were "distressing and disturbing." Days later, Nintendo pledged to increase the number of female managers.

Several female game testers told Kotaku that they'd faced multiple forms of harassment and discrimination at Nintendo. Senior-ranking testers allegedly made unwanted advances and comments. Anti-LGBT remarks, pay gaps and attempts to suppress criticism were also part of the workplace culture, according to the allegations. Female workers are believed to be underrepresented at Nintendo as a whole (37 percent), and particularly among contract-based game testers (10 percent).

It's too soon to know if any investigation will lead to firings or reforms. If accurate, however, the scoop is a reminder that misconduct complaints haven't been limited to one developer. Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft and others have had to address concerns as well — it may reflect cultural issues across the industry.

Sweeping report alleges inequity, sexual harassment at Nintendo’s American HQ

NoA full-timers accused of "using the tester pool of associates as a dating pool."

Through the first half of 2022, Nintendo of America has been in the crosshairs of critics and the US National Labor Relations Board thanks to reports and formal complaints about working conditions for its contracted employees, all brought into the spotlight after a reported layoff allegedly involved pro-union sentiment. In the months since that story broke out publicly, Kotaku reporter Sisi Jiang has tracked down even more allegations about the famed game publisher's American headquarters—and the allegations land squarely in the domain of sexual harassment and gender inequity.

A sweeping report published at Kotaku on Tuesday recounts roughly one decade of internal incidents among NoA's pool of temporary employees, dating back to "the early Wii U era," backed by a number of on-the-record allegations from former Nintendo staffers along with anonymous reports. The report includes attempts to reach out to Nintendo of America's leadership, an associated temp agency, and individual staffers who were named as workplace sexual harassers, but Kotaku says it never received answers to its questions.

Many of the reported issues revolve around a divide between full-time employees, colloquially known as "red badges," and the rest of the company's American workforce, which was managed by temp hiring agency Aerotek before that company was absorbed into another company during a recent reorganization. The women who spoke to Kotaku both on and off the record collectively suggest that their hopes for turning part-time status into a full-time Nintendo career were strained by being women. One anonymous source said, "your chance was probably worse as a girl," while another who spoke on the record suggested women weren't given work-related goals or metrics to grow their careers, instead being told to essentially increase "face time" with male colleagues.

According to the sources, this unclear path to advancement led to issues where women faced workplace sexual harassment, then had to brush it off in order to not be perceived as "overly sensitive" and have a clearer path to becoming a red badge, complete with more stable pay and benefits.

    She left the company after being "warned to be less outspoken."

One former QA tester suggests she found this out the hard way after reporting a male translator's uncouth behavior in a workplace Microsoft Teams chat room in 2020, which included comments about his favorite Pokemon character to have sex with and his attraction to a clearly underage female character in the free-to-play video game Genshin Impact. The staffer in question, who spoke anonymously, says she left the company after Aerotek not only failed to act on the report but also "warned her to be less outspoken," all while colleagues figured out that she had filed the complaint and "blamed her" for doing so.
Commended for “being tougher than the girl who had cried”

As one example of temp employees enduring sexual harassment to stay on the job, Kotaku describes the decades-long tenure of one full-time lead at Nintendo's QA department by citing both anonymous and on-the-record allegations about his unprofessional behavior. Women at the company were reportedly so aware of this staffer's proclivity to openly hitting on female temp hires during work hours that they warned each other to steer clear of his desk whenever possible, while one former tester spoke on the record to say this man "went after all the associate girls." Yet one woman suggested there wasn't much that affected women could do if they wanted job security at NoA. "If you were friendly with him, you are more likely to be brought back sooner or less likely to be laid off," one anonymous source told Kotaku.

Thanks to those assumptions about access to male employees as a path to career advancement, multiple women alleged that they would endure workplace flirtation to secure "opportunities and access," particularly invites to holiday-themed company parties, which contractors and temp workers could not attend unless they were the guest of a "red badge." That allegation lines up with an anonymous source telling Kotaku that "a lot of the NOA red badges had reputations for using the tester pool of associates as a dating pool."

    "You're just playing hard to get."

Another woman told Kotaku that her tenure at NoA resembled a "frat house," which coincidentally was the same phrase used by a California State agency in its landmark lawsuit about pay disparity and sexual harassment filed against Activision Blizzard in July 2021. The former NoA tester in question once formally complained about male staffers' jokes about video game characters whose skirts flipped, only to receive pushback from male colleagues. Once she stopped formally complaining, she received direct praise: "her supervisor commended her for being tougher than the girl who had cried at the office," Kotaku's Sisi Jiang writes.

Women who identified as queer suggested that they suffered outsize forms of prejudice. One woman alleged she fell out of favor with male NoA colleagues, and thus any career advancement, when she didn't respond to their workplace flirtations ("you’re just playing hard to get," one told her). Two other women who were in a relationship were punished at the workplace for holding hands—a violation of the temp agency's "no-touching" policy that they allege was not administered to their straight colleagues.
Echoes of reports from as far back as 1990

The Kotaku report includes further allegations about disturbing behavior by full-time Nintendo employees, including one account of "stalking" that went on for over six months through 2011 and 2012, along with a suggestion that Nintendo's efforts to increase hiring diversity over the past year have only gone so far—and have reportedly not made a significant impact on the company's pool of women in contract and temp positions. It also suggests that NoA's campus is broken up into "microcosms" that do not include ways for each department's women to communicate directly with each other about workplace concerns.

The recent NLRB investigation is ongoing, and thus its language is quite vague, but its top-level statements leave open the possibility that Nintendo is being investigated for a violation of US labor protections. It's not the first time Nintendo of America has dealt with criticism over its hiring practices, though this requires rewinding to 1990, when the then-skyrocketing company faced scrutiny for its treatment of Black contract employees. Not only had Nintendo done a poor job of hiring a proportionate number of Black staffers, an advocacy group alleged, the company also had a track record of advancing white men from contract to full-time status in scant amounts of time ("2-3 months") while leaving qualified Black employees outside the career advancement track.

This storyline replayed when the same advocacy group protested Nintendo's plans to purchase the Major League Baseball team Seattle Mariners in the early '90s. "Approximately two years ago, over 95 percent of all African Americans employed by Nintendo appealed to [us] for assistance to help improve the discriminatory conditions that existed at NOA’s Redmond, Washington, facility," Core Group wrote to regulators in 1992.

Nintendo's price fixing fine reduced by £27m

Cooperation with EU court prompts reduction for Nintendo and distributors
Matt Martin avatar
News by Matt Martin Contributor
Published on May 1, 2009

Nintendo's fine by the European Court for price fixing has been reduced from EUR 149.128 (GBP 132.767) to EUR 119.24 million (GBP 106.15m).

The fine was originally imposed on Nintendo and seven of is distribution partners in Europe, including John Menzies in the UK, for fixing prices on hardware and software between 1991 and 1998.

Nintendo said it would fight the decision last May, and the reduction has been granted following Nintendo and its distributors' co-operating with the court ruling.

"The Court recalled that the basic amount of the fine may be reduced where the undertaking has effectively cooperated in the proceedings," stated the court. "In the contested decision, the Commission took account of John Menzies’s cooperation, with the result that it reduced that undertaking’s fine by 40 per cent.

"The Court held that pursuant to the principle of equal treatment, since Nintendo produced the relevant documents at the same stage of the procedure and its cooperation must be regarded as comparable, it must benefit in this respect from the same level of reduction of fine."

A fine on Nintendo's distributor in Belgium and Luxembourg, CD Contact Data, was also cut from EUR 1 million to EUR 500,000.

Nintendo fined for price fixing
Nintendo images
The price-fixing claims date back to the 1990s
Nintendo has been fined 149m euros (£92.1m) by the European Commission for trying to rig the computer game market.

The firm and seven distributors have been found guilty by commission anti-trust officials of attempting to keep prices artificially high in some EU states between 1991 and 1998.


In view of the size of the fine, Nintendo will lodge an appeal

Nintendo statement
The severity of the fine, the fourth highest ever meted out by commission trade watchdogs for a single offence, reflected Nintendo's role as "the driving force behind the illicit behaviour", the commission said.

The distributors, including Scotland-based John Menzies, were fined 18m euros.

Appeal

But Nintendo said it would fight the penalty.

"In view of the size of the fine, which Nintendo finds surprising, Nintendo will lodge an appeal," the company said.

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti
Mario Monti: Price fixing "not tolerated"

While accepting that it had broken EU rules, the firm said it had reformed its practices.

John Menzies, which said its fine of £5.4m was "totally disproportionate", said it was considering legal options.

The firm was implicated through its THE Games unit between 1995 and 1997.

"We feel that the commission has not fully recognised... [its] earlier acceptance that this was a mistake, not a deliberate transgression; that THE Games was more victim than villain," Menzies chief executive, David Mackay said.

Price differences

The fines follow a two-year probe by the commission into claims that Nintendo prevented distributors from selling goods from low-cost countries in states where prices were higher.

Prices of Nintendo products were up to 65% higher in Germany or the Netherlands than in Britain.

"Every year, millions of European families spend large amounts of money on video games," Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.

"They have the right to buy the games and consoles at the lowest price the market can possibly offer.

"We will not tolerate... behaviour intended to keep prices artificially high in the European single market."

The Irish Widow is a play by David Garrick first staged at Drury Lane Theatre on 23 October 1772.[1] It was written in less than a week by Garrick and resembled the plot of Le Mariage forcé by Molière.[2] A comedy, it depicts an elderly man who falls in love with his nephew's fiancée, the young Irish Widow Brady, and uses his control over his nephew's inheritance to end the relationship setting off a chain of events.[3] The play was a success and was performed frequently until the 1820s.[4]

Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC, currently branded as Reckitt, formerly known as Reckitt Benckiser, is a British multinational consumer goods company headquartered in Slough, United Kingdom.[3] It is a producer of health, hygiene and nutrition products.[4] The company was formed in 1999 by the merger of British company Reckitt & Colman plc and Dutch company Benckiser N.V.

Reckitt's brands include the antiseptic brand Dettol, the analgesic Disprin,[5] the sore throat medicine Strepsils, the toilet cleaner Harpic, the hair removal brand Veet, the immune support supplement Airborne,[6] the Australian insecticide brand Mortein, the indigestion remedy Gaviscon, the baby food brand Mead Johnson, the air freshener Air Wick, and other brands and products like: Calgon, Clearasil, Cillit Bang, Durex, Lysol, Mycil, Enfamil, and Vanish.[7][5]

Johann Benckiser founded a business in Pforzheim, Germany, in 1823.[8] Its core business was industrial chemicals.[9] Ludwig Reimann, a chemist, joined the business in 1828 and married Benckiser's daughter.[10] Benckiser died in 1851[11] and the business came under Reimann's ownership.[10] Reimann opened a new chemical plant and, in 1858, moved it to Ludwigshafen.[10] Under Reimann's descendants the business grew rapidly in the latter half of the 20th century: it acquired Coty, Inc., a North American beauty products manufacturer, in 1992.[12] Benckiser's other products included Vanish and Cillit Bang.[8] It went public in 1997.[13][14]

Reckitt & Sons started in 1840 when Isaac Reckitt rented a starch mill in Hull, England.[9] He diversified into other household products and after his death in 1862, the business passed to his three sons.[15] In 1886, Reckitt opened its first overseas business in Australia.[15] The firm was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1888.[9] Harpic Lavatory Cleaners was acquired in 1932, and that same year, Dettol was launched.[15]

In 1938, Reckitt & Sons merged with J. & J. Colman, which had been founded in 1814 when Jeremiah Colman began milling flour and mustard in Norwich, England,[9] to become Reckitt & Colman Ltd.[9] The company made several acquisitions, including the Airwick and Carpet Fresh brands (1985),[16] the Spanish cleaning products company Camp (1989),[17] the Boyle-Midway division of American Home Products (1990),[18] and the Lehn & Fink division of Sterling Drug, maker of Lysol disinfectant (1994). The Lehn & Fink purchase doubled Reckitt & Colman's American business in one stroke.[19] It acquired several brands from DowBrands in 1998.[20]

Reckitt & Colman also made several divestments during this time, including the fine arts and graphical products (with brands such as Winsor & Newton) and Conimex Dutch food business in 1990, Colman's of Norwich UK food business and Robinsons soft drink products in 1995, and Keen's Australian and Canadian food business in 1998.[9][21][22]
1999 to present

The company was formed by a merger between Britain's Reckitt & Colman plc and the Dutch company Benckiser NV in December 1999. Bart Becht became CEO of the new company and has been credited for its transformation, focusing on core brands and improving efficiency in the supply chain. The new management team's strategy of "innovation marketing" – a combination of increased marketing spend and product innovation, focusing on consumer needs – has been linked to the company's ongoing success. For example, in 2008, the company's "rapid succession of well publicised new product variants" were credited for helping them "to capture shoppers' imagination".[23] Business Week has also noted that "40% of Reckitt Benckiser's $10.5 billion in 2007 revenues came from products launched within the previous three years."[24]

In October 2005, Reckitt purchased the over-the-counter drugs manufacturing business of Boots, Boots Healthcare International, for £1.9 billion. The three main brands acquired were Nurofen's analgesics, Strepsils sore throat lozenges, and Clearasil anti-acne treatments.[25] In January 2008, Reckitt acquired Adams Respiratory Therapeutics, a pharmaceutical company, for $2.3 billion; one of the major brands acquired was Mucinex.[26] Reckitt acquired SSL International, the manufacturer of Durex condoms and Scholl's footcare products, for £2.5 billion in July 2010.[27]

In January 2011, Reckitt purchased Combe's cold remedy/skin care business.[28] In September 2011, Bart Becht retired as CEO of Reckitt Benckiser, being replaced by executive vice-president of Category Development, Rakesh Kapoor, who had played a key role in recent acquisitions.[29]

On 27 August 2011, Reckitt recalled all remaining stock of its major analgesic product, Nurofen Plus, after packs were found to contain an antipsychotic drug.[30] It turned out that this was the work of a codeine addict who had been stealing the pills and replacing them with his anti psychotic medication.[31]

In November 2012, Reckitt acquired Schiff Nutrition, a Salt Lake City-based manufacturer of vitamins and nutritional supplements including Digestive Advantage, MegaRed, Airborne, and Move Free, for US$1.4 billion (£877 million).[32][33] In December 2014, Reckitt spun off its speciality pharmaceuticals business, which produces Suboxone (an opioid withdrawal medication), into a separate company named Indivior.[34]

In 2014, Reckitt Benckiser dropped its full name in favour of the RB brand. According to Kapoor, the old name was "a bit of a mouthful" and the name change would make life easier.'[35]

In February 2017, the company bid $16.7 billion for the American infant formula maker Mead Johnson.[36][37] In February 2017, Reckitt Benckiser announced it had bought Mead Johnson for $16.6 billion.[38] To effect the transaction, Reckitt Benckiser incorporated a subsidiary in Delaware into which Mead Johnson Nutrition would be transferred, with Mead Johnson Nutrition being the sole surviving entity at completion.[39] Following the acquisition of Mead Johnson, Reckitt Benckiser split its business into two divisions: consumer healthcare, and home and hygiene. While some expert analysts viewed this move as a precursor to a possible sale of the home division, Kapoor said that it was only to improve the performance of each of the divisions.[40]

In July 2017, McCormick acquired Reckitt's food brands, including French's Mustard & Frank's RedHot, for $4.2 billion, subject to regulatory approval.[41][42]

Kapoor retired in September 2019[43] and was replaced by Laxman Narasimhan, PepsiCo's global chief commercial officer.[44] Narasimhan developed a turnaround strategy designed to rejuvenate the company "following a series of missteps and lacklustre growth that marked the final years of his predecessor".[45]

In March 2021, the company rebranded from RB to Reckitt - including a new logo and visual identity as a next step in delivering on the strategic purpose of the company.[46]

On 1 September 2022, Reckitt announced that Narasimhan had chosen to resign as CEO, citing "personal and family reasons",[47] and would relinquish his position at the end of the month. It was also revealed that he is expected to become the next CEO of Starbucks.[48] Narasimhan's unexpected departure "came as an unwelcome shock to shareholders",[49] with the company's share price falling by "more than 5 per cent in early trading [...] before recovering somewhat to 4.5 per cent below their opening price" on the day of the announcement.[45]

Senior Independent Director Nicandro Durante was appointed to serve as CEO on an "interim"[50] basis "while the board considers a longer-term replacement".[51]
Operations

Reckitt is headquartered in Slough, Berkshire, England, and has operations in around 60 countries. Its products are sold in nearly 200 countries.[52] Reckitt organises the majority of its products into three main categories – health, hygiene and home – with other brands belonging to three further categories: food, pharmaceuticals and portfolio brands. The company's strategy is to have a highly focused portfolio concentrating on its 19 most profitable brands, which are responsible for 70% of net revenues.[53]

Corporate governance

As of 2020, Reckitt's directors were: Christopher Sinclair (chairman), Laxman Narasimhan (CEO), Jeff Carr (CFO), Andrew Bonfield, Nicandro Durante, Mary Harris, Dr. Mehmood Khan, Dr. Pamela Kirby, Sara Mathew, Elane Stock, and Warren Tucker.[54] As of 2020, members of the executive committee were: Laxman Narasimhan (CEO), Rupert Bondy (General Counsel), Jeff Carr (CFO), Kris Licht, Aditya Sehgal, Ranjay Radhakrishnan, and Harold van den Broek.[55]

From the company's creation in 1999 until he retired in 2011, Bart Becht was CEO. The Guardian called him "one of the most successful businessmen of his generation". Under him, the company focused on its core brands, and on improving efficiency in the supply chain. It also increased its marketing budget.[23] BusinessWeek noted that "40% of Reckitt's $10.5 billion in 2007 revenues came from products launched within the previous three years".[24] Becht was Britain's highest-paid businessman, taking home more than £90 million in 2009.[56] In April 2011, he announced that he would step down in September of that year, to be replaced by Rakesh Kapoor, who had been with the company since 1987. Reckitt Benckiser shares fell by 6.6% on the news.[57]
Corporate public relations

The company supports Save the Children.[58] Reckitt has also implemented an environmental initiative called Carbon 20.[59] The initiative, which was announced in November 2007, aimed to cut the total carbon footprint of its products—from creation to disposal by 20% by 2020. As part of the initiative the company has reduced by 70% the amount of plastic in the packaging of its Vanish cleaner.[60]
Lawsuit

In New York in February 2009, Earthjustice filed a lawsuit against Reckitt and others. The petition seeks to compel the companies to identify all of the ingredients used in their products.[61] Earthjustice contacted several companies in September 2008 requesting that they comply with a 1971 law requiring them to disclose the ingredients in their products and make available any associated health or safety studies. Reckitt and the other defendants ignored or refused the request.[62] Earthjustice eventually lost the case, after which it lobbied the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, which in 2018 unveiled new requirements for manufacturers of cleaning products to publicly detail their ingredients.[63]
Controversies
Deaths caused by humidifier disinfectant
Main article: South Korean humidifier disinfectant case

In 2001, Reckitt Benckiser acquired the South Korean Oxy brand from Oriental Chemical Industries. Since 1996, Oxy had been using polyhexamethylene guanidine (PHMG) in a humidifier steriliser product called Oxy Ssak Ssak (옥시싹싹). In 2011, the use of PHMG was dropped when the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) published a report showing a link between the compound and lung damage and deaths.[64] Several other companies in South Korea made humidifier sterilisers with PHMG between 2001 and 2011.[65]

According to a BBC report in May 2016, about 500 people, many of them women and children, are reported to have died or been injured after inhaling PHMG.[65] According to a The Korea Herald report in April 2016, in 2015, 750 disinfectant users had requested a test to determine if they had been harmed by the disinfectant and as of the date of that report, 221 had been confirmed and full results were expected to be released late in 2017.[66] A report on Sina.com in May 2016 said that PHMG was known to have caused 70 deaths and to harmed the lungs of 177 people, with the actual total of deaths and people injured unknown.[64]

Reckitt Benckiser Korea has been blamed for 103 deaths by a coalition of consumer groups in South Korea;[67] a report from The Korea Herald in April 2016 said that the firm had been blamed for 221 deaths.[66]

Sometime after the release of the KCDC report, prosecutors in South Korea opened an investigation into the companies selling the disinfectants, which increased its pace in January 2016.[66] Reckitt Benckiser Korea submitted a toxicity report on PHMG to prosecutors in January 2016; prosecutors were also investigating allegations that the company suppressed data showing PHMG to be toxic in the report it had submitted.[66] In April 2016, a coalition of consumer groups called for a boycott of the company.[67]

In May 2016, Korean division chief Ataur "Ata" Safdar apologised to victims and families in a press conference and offered compensation to the families of those who died and to those who were injured; it was the first time the company had acknowledged that its products containing PHMG were harmful.[65]
Cillit Bang viral marketing controversy

Cillit Bang television advertisements have been presented by "Barry Scott", a brashly enthusiastic character played by Neil Burgess, who claims that Cillit Bang can remove limescale, rust and ground-in dirt. In one advert, he places a copper English one penny coin in Cillit Bang to demonstrate the product's cleaning ability to remove staining. International versions of the advert use different presenters, known as Martin Grellis in Australia and New Zealand, and Dan Dolan in North America, although some spots feature Neil Burgess as Barry Scott. The North American versions of the advertisement use the appropriate one-cent coin (a Lincoln cent in the United States, a 1953–1964 one cent coin in Canada). The company claimed that the coin would be clean in 15 seconds: however the Advertising Standards Agency said the claim was misleading.[68]

In 2005 advertising agency Cohn & Wolfe was contracted by Reckitt to operate a blog as the fictional character Barry Scott as a viral marketing platform. In October of that year blogger Tom Coates wrote an emotional post to his own blog about his long-estranged father. Among the expressions of condolences and sympathy in the post's comment section was one from a user identifying themselves as Barry Scott, with a link back to the Cohn & Wolfe's in-character blog as Barry Scott. Offended by the apparent use of his blog comments on such a personal post as a spam advertising venue, Coates traced the comment's originating IP address through addresses owned by Young & Rubicam and back to Reckitt. Reckitt initially denied responsibility for the message but later wrote Coates an apology acknowledging the message's inappropriateness, and Cohn & Wolfe issued a statement of remorse for their misuse of the "experimental" blog which they then ceased operating.[69][70]

The controversy and its fallout led to further discussions among the blogger community as well as the advertising industry on the ethical issues surrounding blogs being "operated" by fictional characters for the purposes of advertising without being clearly labeled as such, and the extent to which those blogs should be allowed to participate in the greater blogosphere.[71][72][73]

The Barry Scott adverts were parodied by Peter Serafinowicz on The Peter Serafinowicz Show. In the parodies, the host "Derek Baum" (played by Serafinowicz) markets a product called Kitchen Gun, which is a firearm that the host uses to blast away at kitchen surfaces and appliances, cleaning and damaging them at the same time,[74] and Toilet Grenade, a hand grenade covered in white paint that demolishes the toilet bowl to eliminate limescale and germs.[75]
Anti-competitive behaviour

In 2008, the BBC's Newsnight accused Reckitt Benckiser of attempting to delay the introduction of a competitive, generic version of one of its most popular products, Gaviscon, a treatment for heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease. In his introduction, reporter Martin Shankleman said:

    Gaviscon is hailed as a power brand by its owners, Reckitt Benckiser ... Reckitt Benckiser likes to claim that the profits flow from their expertise in marketing. But we know that there's another way in which they've been coining it in—by ripping-off the NHS, as a whistle-blower has told us. The "whistle-blower" was shown in silhouette, and his words were spoken by an actor: "Reckitt's cheated the National Health Service. It could have saved the NHS millions of pounds. But not just the NHS, patients, doctors—they've cheated health professionals. I felt it had to be exposed". He continued, "Newsnight claimed that Reckitt had a "secret plan to ensure that it kept its stranglehold" after the Gaviscon patent expired in 1999, and that Newsnight had seen the plan. The Department of Health asked Newsnight to hand its documents to the NHS counter-fraud service.[76][77]

The investigation was widely reported in the British press. The Guardian quoted a leaked memo in which the product's manager explained that the company could use "the rationale of health and safety" to design a switched product to "muddy the waters".[78] The newspaper quoted Reckitt as stating that the leaked memos were "inappropriate and did not reflect Reckitt's eventual actions".[78]

The Independent quoted Warwick Smith, director of the British Generic Manufacturers Association: "The sort of evergreening alleged by Newsnight can cost the NHS tens of millions of pounds with no patient benefit."[79] It also quoted a statement issued by the company: "...RB is a responsible company and we have therefore instigated an immediate internal investigation and will take action. However, we do not accept much of what has been alleged."[79]

The Times noted that "Although Gaviscon has been out of patent for almost ten years, no other manufacturer has developed a cheap generic version. Such a drug could have saved the NHS up to £40 million."[80] It stated that the Office of Fair Trading was expected to examine whether Reckitt had acted illegally. It also printed verbatim extracts from several of the leaked memos.[81]

In response to the Newsnight report and the reports in the press, Reckitt issued a statement that began:

    We are shocked by the allegations made as Reckitt Benckiser is a responsible company in the way it conducts its business.

    Nevertheless, we are deeply concerned by the inappropriate sentiment expressed in some of the historic internal correspondence reported. We take this very seriously and have instigated an immediate internal investigation, and will take action. We also refute much of what has been reported which implies a power and influence we simply do not possess.

    The company has never objected to a monograph driven generic name being published. The timetable of which is not, and never has been, within our control a monograph/generic name could have been published at any time by the regulators without reference to any third party.

    The company made appropriate challenges where it felt it was justified in order to ensure patients are prescribed the right treatment. These were within the law and relevant regulations. We stress that the regulators only take a comment into account when it is valid.[82]

On 15 October 2010, Reckitt was fined £10.2 million by the Office of Fair Trading after the company admitted anti-competitive behaviour.[83]

In 2014, the Autorité de la concurrence in France found that Reckitt had colluded with 12 other multinational companies (Colgate-Palmolive, Henkel, Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Sara Lee, SC Johnson, Bolton Solitaire, Laboratoires Vendôme, Gillette, L'Oréal, Beiersdorf and Vania) to fix the prices of popular personal hygiene products; the fine of around €950 million was the largest ever imposed by the agency.[84]

In 2015, Reckitt created controversy when it emerged that seemingly different versions of their product Nurofen marketed to treat specific pains, such as migraine, were all identical to the standard product despite costing twice as much. The product was withdrawn from sale in Australia for misleading consumers.[85] The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) took the matter to court and in December 2016, Reckitt was fined A$6 million.[86]
Legal challenges to rodenticide regulations

In 2008, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a decision to remove second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides from store shelves, leaving the products available for purchase only by US licensed applicators. The ruling was slated to go into effect in 2011 allowing poison companies time to adjust to the new law. EPA's decision was based on tens of thousands of reports of pet, wildlife and child poisonings that resulted annually from rat poisons in the US alone. In 2011, Reckitt Benckiser makers of d-CON products initiated a legal challenge to the EPA expected to take several years to resolve. Early in 2014, California State Department of Pesticide Regulation ruled that anticoagulant rat poison sales would be restricted beginning on 1 July 2014. Reckitt filed suit in San Diego County Superior Court in April 2014 to block the decision,[87][88] but eventually reached an agreement with the EPA to phase out the products in June 2014; production of the banned products stopped on December 31, 2014, with distribution to retailers ceased on March 31, 2015, although retailers will be allowed to keep the banned products in stock until they are all sold out.[89]
Palm oil procurement

According to a 2016 Amnesty International report, Reckitt Benckiser is one of several consumer companies that buy palm oil from Wilmar International, the world's largest palm oil refiner. Amnesty found that Wilmar profits from child labour and forced labour and exposes workers to toxic banned chemicals.[90]
Opioid marketing

In 2019, Reckitt paid a $1.4bn fine[91] for claiming opioid medication Suboxone Film was "safer ... even though such claims have never been established."[92]
Controversy regarding operations in Russia

Reckitt Benckiser has faced criticism for continuing its operations in Russia despite the invasion of Ukraine and widespread international sanctions. In April 2022, the company announced plans to transfer ownership of its Russian business to a third party or local employees but did not complete the process as of 2024.[93][94] Trading data reveals that Reckitt Benckiser continues to export products to Russia, raising concerns about its commitment to disengaging from the market. While the company has frozen capital investments, advertising, sponsorships, and promotions in Russia, its ongoing presence has drawn scrutiny in light of Russia's continued aggression and violations of international law.[95][96]

2023 Annual Report

The Co-operative Group Limited, trading as Co-op and formerly known as the Co-operative Wholesale Society, is a British consumer co-operative with a group of retail businesses, including grocery retail and wholesale, legal services, funerals and insurance, and social enterprise.[3]

The group has its headquarters located at One Angel Square in Manchester, England. The Group also manages the Co-operative Federal Trading Services, formerly the Co-operative Retail Trading Group (CRTG).
History
Beginnings (1844–1938)
The Hanover Building in Manchester, former headquarters of the Co-operative Wholesale Society

The Co-operative Group has developed over the years from the merger of co-operative wholesale societies and many independent retail societies. The Group's roots are traced back to the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, established in 1844.[4] The Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers was based on the Rochdale Principles – which notably introduced the idea of distributing a share of profits according to purchases through a scheme which became known as the dividend or "Divi".

Although the Co-operative Group incorporates the original Rochdale Society, the business's core for much of its history were its wholesale operations. This began in 1863 when the North of England Co-operative Wholesale Industrial and Provident Society Limited was launched in Manchester by 300 individual co-operatives in Yorkshire and Lancashire. By 1872, it was known as the 'Co-operative Wholesale Society' (CWS) and it was wholly owned by the co-operatives which traded with it.[5][6][7] The CWS grew rapidly and supplied produce to co-operative stores across England, though many co-ops only sourced around a third of their produce through the CWS. It was this continued and fierce competition with other non-co-operative wholesalers which led to the CWS becoming highly innovative. By 1890 the CWS had established significant branches in Leeds, Blackburn, Bristol, Nottingham and Huddersfield alongside a number of factories which produced biscuits (Manchester), boots (Leicester), soap (Durham) and textiles (Batley). In an attempt to drive down the significant cost of transportation for produce the CWS even began its own shipping line which initially sailed from Goole docks to parts of continental Europe. One of the CWS' steamships, the Pioneer, was the first commercial vessel to use the Manchester Ship Canal. This rapid expansion continued so that by the outbreak of World War I the CWS had major offices in the United States, Denmark, Australia and a tea plantation in India.[6]

There was a great deal of consideration on the role of the CWS in the British co-operative movement around the turn of the twentieth century. Many, fiercely local, societies saw the CWS as a valuable supplier but did not want to exclusively purchase produce from them owing to perceptions of high cost (mostly transport costs) and unreliable quality – some things the CWS were at pains to resolve. In contrast to this, the CWS had its aim to be the centrepoint for the whole co-operative movement in the UK and lobbied hard for loyalty from co-ops. To this end, they started to assist the local retail societies in more ways than simply as a wholesaler. The CWS Bank, the precursor to The Co-operative Bank, financed loans for societies to use for expansion through purchasing new buildings, land or new equipment. After the acquisition of the Co-operative Insurance Society in 1913, the CWS also provided insurance services to members and the CWS also began providing legal services – all businesses which form parts of the Co-operative Group today. It was hoped that these financial ties, as well as the CWS corporate dividend, would increase loyalty to the CWS.[6]
World War II and post-war decline (1939–1989)

During the Second World War, rationing led to an effective pause in any major changes to the co-operative movement in the UK with the CWS becoming highly involved in sourcing overseas goods for UK consumers and manufacturing wartime goods.

During this time, the CWS began planning for the future, as even then they could see the potential disruption to the retail market that the new multiple grocers could have. What was less obvious at the time would be the impact of National Savings and national taxation on the movement, as Britain shifted from a country of friendly, building and co-operative societies, to one with a National Health Service, National House building programs and National Post Office Bank NS&I GPO. In 1944, the CWS published a report entitled Policy and Programme for Post War Development which focused on methods for revitalising the co-op movement after the war had ended. The report suggested merging the CWS with the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society (SCWS); reducing the number of co-operative societies through merger; moving into the manufacturing and production of white goods and the expansion of the Co-operative Bank.

This report received much criticism from the fiercely local co-operative societies and the proposals of the report were only partly and slowly implemented. The end of war allowed some attempt to modernise the co-operative stores around this time, while the slow demobilisation of the wartime boost of full employment and high wages partly waned consumer spending power. After the London Co-operative Society opened its first self-service shop in 1942, the co-operative movement led the way on the development of self-service stores to the point where, by the 1950s, 90% of self-service shops in the UK were run by co-operatives.[8] Despite this the subscribed share capital (risk capital) available to societies to innovate and take risks dwindled causing market share and relative quality of the service societies could offer their members to dwindle. Consequently, this impacted the movement by reducing the number of society members willing to enter membership and then actively trade with their co-operatives, leading to further real terms falls in withdraw-able member share capital levels, and in the level or return generated co-operative investment in the form of lower interest and dividends. A corollary of falling market share was continued ownership of freehold land, property and infrastructure, such as warehouses, dairies and farmland (the Co-operative Farms) built up by societies with accumulated surpluses from the 50 years of growth before the war.[6]

The Co-operative Independent Commission (1958) was tasked with investigating the decline in the co-op movement and for making recommendations for revitalising the movement in the future. Its recommendations had two main thrusts: that a strong response to the emerging multiple-store supermarket chains (including the appointment of professional managers)[7] was needed and that the Co-op needed to come to terms with the rise in consumerism and to move away from its association with the "working poor" rather than a more prosperous working class.

The CWS responded with operation facelift in 1968 which introduced the first national co-operative branding, the 'Co-op' cloverleaf.

Though Operation Facelift led to some improvements, the movement (including the CWS) remained largely unreformed with its grocery market share continuing a downward trend.[7] Again, it was suggested that societies merge to form regional societies to improve their competitiveness through enhanced economies of scale. Many local co-op societies strongly resisted such mergers but, as their financial situation declined, many were forced to merge to create regional societies or were absorbed into either the CRS or the SCWS to avoid failing. Consolidation within the movement was considerable, and in 1973 serious financial mismanagement of the SCWS Bank led to the SCWS and the CWS merging to form a single UK-wide wholesale society.

The merger did highlight the potential of The Co-operative Bank as it was building a sizeable base of customers (notably local authorities, mutuals and local groups alongside co-operative societies) and this became an increasingly significant proportion of the CWS's annual profits. The growth in the bank largely related to its aggressive expansion into the personal banking market and with the pioneering of free banking (1972) in the UK, nine years before any of its larger rivals.[6]

The co-operative movement's marketshare and profitability continued to decline during the 1970s and 1980s, in part, due to a number of reasons.

Firstly, the process of deindustrialization, that had characterised the period led to serious economic difficulties in many of the movements heartlands (notably the northern industrial towns), which disproportionally impacted on the societies through a decrease in consumer spending despite the British economy seeing a rise in overall consumer disposable income. This was largely due to the strong increase in wealth and social inequality in the UK at this time. The co-operative movement was not well placed to tap into this increase in middle class spending due to the geographic spread of its stores and The Co-op's historic association as the shop for the "working poor".

Secondly, redevelopment projects in many cities between the 1950s and 1970s often moved people from rows of terraced housing (which featured co-op stores dotted throughout) to newer purpose-built estates, with around 18,000 co-op stores closing as they had become redundant.

Thirdly, the time was a period of notable inflation and a strong pound, which had led to a wave of cheap imported goods – this devastated much of the UK's manufacturing industries (including the CWS). By the 1980s, it became clear that the trend in the retail sector was towards large (often out of town) supermarkets and hypermarkets with hundreds of them appearing across the UK.

The co-operative movement did build some superstores, having 74 by 1986, but often their development and competitiveness was hindered by the lack of a national distribution network and price competitiveness. In an attempt to improve the collective buying power of the movement the CWS acted to reposition itself from a wholesaler (from which societies can choose to buy) to a 'buying group' (where the CWS buys on behalf of), in order that CWS could increase the proportion of produce sold through co-operative stores that was sourced by itself. Though this did work to increase loyalty, it was not until the 2000s with the development of the Co-operative Retail Trading Group that the CWS became the de facto wholesaler for co-operative stores.[6]

During the 1980s, the CWS began to merge with a number of failing co-operative societies, having returned to direct retailing after its merger with the SCWS the decade before. These mergers with consumers' co-operatives led to the co-op having both corporate (co-op societies) and individual members, hence making it both a primary and secondary co-operative.[7] The CWS's expansion into direct retailing (especially after the mergers of the 2000s) led to the CWS becoming a highly visible business in the UK. The legacy of this was that many people perceive the British co-operative movement to be one business, The Co-operative Group, or co-op for short.[6]
Modernisation and takeover attempts (1990–1999)

By the start of the 1990s, the co-operative movement's share of the UK grocery market had declined to the point where the entire business model was in question. This was at a time when many building societies were demutualising as many of the public preferred the short-term financial gain of the windfall payment over the perceived lack of benefits from the mutual model. For a time it seemed as though the mutual or co-op model was almost dead.

The Co-op's reputation was not helped in this respect by the factions within the movement, notably the strong rivalry between the CRS and the CWS, acting in a manner which exacerbated the belief held by many members of the public that, rather than working for the interests of all members, co-ops were largely acting in the self-interests of a dominant 'clique' of members within each society.

Together these crises meant that the 1990s would become a crucial decade if the Co-op was to survive. In order to raise capital to invest in its food stores (and also the increasingly successful Co-operative Bank), the CWS sold many of its factories to Andrew Regan in 1994 for £111 million in what initially appeared to be a highly beneficial arrangement for the CWS.

However, later it appeared that those involved in this deal did so without the CWS Board's permission and had been also handing confidential CWS files to Regan. Notably, one Sunday newspaper printed the CWS' annual report before it had been officially released. This would later pose a huge threat to the CWS when in 1997 Regan posed a highly ambitious £1.2bn hostile takeover attempt of the CWS.[9] This shocked many in the movement and consolidated support for the CWS as the 'linchpin' of the movement in a way that many had previously opposed.

The CWS, under the leadership of Graham Melmoth, was able to defend itself from this takeover bid, largely by informing Regan's creditors that his hostile takeover was based upon dubiously sourced data and bad business practices. The deal also failed because Regan had greatly misunderstood the CWS' complicated ownership structure, assuming that by paying off the 500,000 'active members' he could gain control of the CWS.

Though this strategy worked for the carpetbaggers working to demutualise UK building societies at the time, it failed to recognise that the ownership actually lay with millions of ordinary members and that many of these 'active members' were staunch co-operators and who would be unlikely to back the bid.

After investigations by a private detective and a subsequent criminal court case, Regan's bid was rejected and two senior CWS executives were dismissed and imprisoned for fraud. An arrest warrant was issued for Andrew Regan in 1999 however he had already emigrated to Monaco.[6][10]

The shock that Regan's bid sent through the co-operative movement has been attributed with sowing the seeds for the reduced hostilities between the CWS and CRS factions which eventually ended with the CRS becoming a member of the CRTG before fully merging with the CWS in 1999.[11] The merger took two years to complete and the launch of the newly combined business, named The Co-operative Group, was timed with the release of the 2001 Co-operative Commission report, chaired by John Monks, which proposed a strategy of modernisation.[12]

The report focused on improving store design and building a consistent branding whilst also driving for efficiency savings to make the food business more competitive – the similarity in conclusions between the 1919, 1958 and 2001 reports highlights the distinct lack of progress within the movement during this time. The 2001 report also highlighted the need to market what it called 'The Co-operative Advantage'; a favourite idea of Graham Melmoth, which suggested that commercial success would provide the funding for the social goals of the movement which (when the public saw a tangible benefit to their own lives) would provide a competitive advantage to the Co-op which would further its commercial success – a virtuous cycle. Unlike Gaitskell Commission's 1958 report the recommendations of the report, notably the major update to "The Co-operative brand" and the re-launch of the membership dividend scheme, were largely adopted by the co-operative movement including The Co-operative Group. These changes to the business are largely credited with the successes in profitability and the achievement in social goals which improved in the years after the Co-operative Commission report.[13]

As a part of the CWS-CRS merger, new governance arrangements were designed with the 'independent societies' becoming part owners of the new Group and their representatives were elected to the group's national board. The largest change, however, was the much stronger representation for the individual members of the retailing operation with a string of regional boards and area committees designed to facilitate a clear democracy and representation on a local and national level. The composite nature of the Co-op as both a primary and a secondary co-operative led to the business having both individual members and corporate members (independent co-operative societies) which had to be included in any democratic structure. This led to a governance arrangement which was complicated and not understood by many individual members and which led to relatively few members becoming democratically engaged with the business. During 2007 the then chief executive Martin Beaumont was critical of the lack of commercial expertise on the board, foreshadowing the conclusions drawn from later Myners review into the near failure of the business during 2013 which was (in part) due to an unfit governance arrangement.[7] In 2014 the governance arrangements were completely redesigned to reflect the recommendations of the Myners review – for more information see the governance section.
Establishing the "Co-operative difference"

Though the modernisation of the business was most noticeable after the 1997 takeover attempt, this is not to say that modernisation of the CWS had not been under way for some time. Since 1993 the CRTG had been working to switch the role of the CWS from "selling to" to "buying for" co-operative societies as a way of maximising the economies of scale to become more competitive to the major supermarkets. Since the 1960s the Co-op had been following retail trends after they had occurred, always having to catch up, in a way that it led the changes before the Second World War. Many leaders within the movement began to appreciate that this 'me too' approach to retailing was not working, for example, expanding into hypermarkets after Tesco and Sainsbury's had already developed a dominant position, but without the resources to compete on price. After the 1997 strategic review the business suggested that it close the majority of its hypermarkets and department stores and instead focus on its core chain of convenience stores.[6]

As a further attempt to differentiate itself from its larger competitors The Co-operative Bank had introduced an ethical policy in 1992 and this, along with its technical innovation, was well received with customers. The CWS decided that, though it had always aimed to trade responsibly (for example though the working conditions in its factories and plantations as well as its boycott of South African produce during the years of apartheid[14]), by cementing its "ethical" credentials in a series of strong and clear policy commitments it could work to convince the public of the "co-operative difference".

This move posed a bold step for the CWS leadership as this was a wholly new approach for such a large business. As a part of this, the Co-op worked with The Fairtrade Foundation to help introduce the Fairtrade Mark in the UK. It was an early adopter of the RSPCA's 'Freedom Foods' animal welfare certification. It introduced the first supermarket range of 'environmentally friendly' household products and the first range of toiletries certified by Cruelty Free International as "not tested on animals".

This new adoption of an ethical strategy was only part of the CWS' changes. The Co-op had been pioneering on notable changes to its packaging with nutritional labelling on food (1985) and later introduced Braille on its packaging. Many own brand products were also reformulated to reduce the amount of salt, sugar and fat in order to make the product range more healthy. So successful was this initiative that competitors such as Sainsbury's and Marks and Spencer began to follow aggressively on these initiatives.

In an attempt to build upon the success which was being felt around the increasing public perception of the Co-op as an ethical retailer and to implement what was a core recommendation of the 2001 Co-operatives Commission, The Co-operative Group launched a brand panel which was tasked with developing a single consistent national branding standard for the movement. For decades, marketing by co-operatives was confusing for many customers with different societies adopting different store names (notably "Co-op Welcome" and "Co-op Late Shop"), various shop fascia designs and inconsistent marketing. Also, the cloverleaf design of the Co-op logo was seen by many as too associated with the years of neglect and decline within the movement and hence The Co-operative Group aimed to launch a totally new brand.

The new "The Co-operative" branding was first displayed at the 2005 co-operative congress and became the first brand which could bring together all of the co-operative businesses (both those of The Group and the independent societies) under a single consistent brand. With the brand came a set of standards which any outlet using the brand must adhere to – to maintain a high standard of impression with customers. A twelve-month pilot of the new branding followed and these suggested that a significant growth in sales followed the re-branding of stores, largely understood to result from a major impact on public perceptions. Not all of the independent societies joined this new branding however, with United Co-operatives (prior to its merger with the Co-operative Group), the Scottish Midland Co-operative Society and the Lincolnshire Co-operative Society not adopting the new brand design. In combination with the new "The Co-operative" redesign, the Co-op sought to relaunch the co-operative membership scheme using a single consistent national standard and featuring the re-introduction of the member dividend.[6]

Together, this renewed focus on responsible trading, the redesign of "The Co-operative" brand and the reintroduction of the member dividend helped to build the start of a renewed relationship with the British public. In 2006 a survey found the Co-op to be the most trusted major retailer in the UK and almost six million people joined the membership scheme over the following five years. Even after The Co-operative Group's financial crisis of 2013 the 'Have Your Say' survey found that more than 70% of the public agreed that the Co-op 'tries to do the right thing'.[15]
Expansion (2000–2012)

Following the integration of the CRS and CWS into the new Group structure it became evident that the business required significant modernisation and rationalisation of its businesses. The Co-operative Group followed by selling its loss-making footwear and milk processing businesses as well as some aspects of its agricultural production. The business also sold many of its larger supermarkets and hypermarkets using the funds to expand further into the convenience store sector, notably through adding 600 stores, following the acquisition of the Alldays chain.[16] Alldays had previously purchased the VG chain of small supermarkets, which operated a franchise operation, supplying marketing and own-brand products to independently owned grocers. The Co-op invested significantly in distribution facilities, notably by opening a purpose-built National Distribution Centre in Coventry during 2006.[17]

As a result of their steady expansion after 2000 the Pharmacy and Funeralcare businesses were performing well, however the farming business was poorly aligned with the needs of the food stores and so was significantly reorganised in 2007 to focus the farmland on producing produce for the business's food stores. The co-op also moved into new business opportunities during this period adding a legal services business (providing conveyancing, will writing and probate services) and an Energy Generation business, the latter included significant investment in renewable energy generation which formed another key aspect of the co-op's drive towards its ethical image. This period was successful for the co-op in increasing its profitability and in beginning to rationalise what had been a sprawling but rather unsuccessful conglomerate. Many however, believed that for the co-op to survive in the long term it would need to merge with other large co-operative societies.

At the start of 2007, the group began discussions with United Co-operatives, then the UK's second-largest co-operative, about a merger of the societies.[18] Such a merger was expected to lead to significant efficiency savings owing to the large duplication of services which the two societies provided. On 16 February 2007, the boards announced they were to merge subject to members' approval, and on 28 July 2007 the newly enlarged Co-operative Group was launched. At the same time, the group transferred the engagements of the Scottish Nith Valley Co-operative Society which, while trading profitably, was suffering a burden with its pension fund commitments.[19]

Before the United merger was complete, the Chief Executive, Peter Marks, was already preparing another significant acquisition as he believed that only though significant growth could the co-operative become truly sustainable in the long term. In July 2008, the group announced a deal to purchase the Somerfield chain of 900 supermarkets and convenience stores.[20][21] The sale was completed on 2 March 2009, costing £1.57 bn.[20] The conversion and rebranding of Somerfield stores into Coop stores took just over two years and was completed by summer 2011.[22]

In 2008, the group bought ten convenience stores trading as Bell's and Jackson's in the north and east of England from Sainsbury's.[23]

In autumn 2008, Lothian, Borders & Angus Co-operative Society members voted to transfer engagements to the Co-operative Group. The transfer came into effect on 13 December 2008. The group announced in November 2008 that despite the economic downturn, half-year profits had risen by 35.6 per cent to £292.6 million for the six months to June 2008.[24] In January 2009, Co-operative Financial Services and the Britannia Building Society announced their intention to merge, subject to regulatory and member approval. Members of the Plymouth & South West Co-operative Society joined the Co-operative Group in September 2009.[25][citation needed]

The Group's reputation suffered in 2007 when 38 of its 41 stores in Sussex failed fire safety inspections and it was fined £250,000.[26] It was fined £210,000 in 2010 after an investigation at one of its Southampton stores.[27]
CIS Tower and One Angel Square in Manchester, England

In May 2010, the Co-operative Group unveiled plans to build a new headquarters in Manchester. The initial phase of construction commenced on Miller Street near the existing estate where the Group has been based since 1863. The project, entitled NOMA, aims to reflect ethical values of the organisation in its design, construction and its relationship with employees and the surrounding communities. The centrepiece of the initial development is One Angel Square, one of the largest buildings in Europe to have a BREEAM Outstanding Distinction as a result of its high sustainable energy credentials. Occupation of the new building began in early 2013.[28]
Financial crisis (2013–2014)

In May 2013, after recognising inadequate capital levels in its banking group, Euan Sutherland took over from Peter Marks as Chief Executive.[29] That month Moody's downgraded the bank's credit rating by six notches to junk status (Ba3) and the bank's Chief Executive, Barry Tootell, resigned.[30] The difficulties stem largely from the commercial loans of the Britannia Building Society, acquired in the 2009 merger.[31] The Co-operative Insurance sold its life insurance and pensions business to Royal London releasing about £200M in capital, and planned to dispose of its general insurance business. Further financial restructuring was expected.[29]

On 5 June 2013, Richard Pennycook, former Finance Director of Morrisons, was named The Co-operative Group's Finance Director, and Richard Pym, former Chief Executive of Alliance & Leicester, as Chair of The Co-operative Banking Group and The Co-operative Bank.[32] The group lost £2.5 billion in 2013,[33] and debt stood at £1.4 billion at the end of 2013.[34][35]

In May 2014, a special member's meeting agreed to restructure the way members elected the board, largely along the lines suggested in a governance report by Lord Myners.[36][37] The Myners Review was very critical of the co-operative movement's (and especially the Group's) lack of response to the 1958 commission report and for the failure of the Group's governance since the merger of CWS and CRS in 2000. The review also underlined the requirement to focus on making and retaining annual profits which can be invested in the long-term future of the business and to avoid the risks of over-expansion and 'empire-building' as had nearly destroyed the business in 2013.[7]

During 2014, the group sold a series of businesses to reduce debt.[38] The Co-operative Pharmacy was sold for £620 million to the Bestway Group, Co-operative Farms was sold for £249 million to the Wellcome Trust, and Sunwin (the group's cash transportation business) was sold for £41.5 million to Cardtronics.[39]
Rebuilding the Co-op (2015–present)

Having scaled back their operations to their core food, funeral, insurance, electrical and legal businesses in the preceding years, the business set about modernising these businesses in order to create a stable and profitable base for the future. In April 2015, The Co-operative Group announced that it had reduced its debt levels by approximately 40% (to £808M) and had made a small profit during 2014, but would not pay a dividend to members until 2018.[40][41] When The Co-operative Group released its annual report in 2016, it showed that its food business was growing faster than the overall grocery market (by 3.2 percentage points) and that like-for-like sales were up 3.8% in its core convenience estate.[42] This reflected the significant growth in the convenience sector in the UK following a shift in consumer habits towards shopping little and often. Owing to their strength in the market, the food business chose to focus on their estate of approximately 2,500 convenience stores, selling over 100 of their larger supermarkets and opening 300 new convenience stores during 2014, 2015 and 2016, particularly in London and the South East of England. The business also sold 298 of its smallest stores to McColl's in 2016 with the aim of providing a more consistent shopping experience by focusing on stores primarily in the 2000–4000 square foot bracket where a greater range of own brand products could be sold.[43] The food range in stores was refreshed with a smaller range of items, that were tailored to individual stores, rather than their previous policy of determining product range purely on store size. The Co-op also shifted to a strategy of driving sales by reducing the price and increasing the quality of products,[44] by increasing the proportion of produce produced in the UK[45][46] and the roll-out of locally sourced products in small clusters of stores (following a successful trial in Yorkshire).[47] As their ethical image had largely recovered after their financial crisis, they focused attention on differentiating the food business through measures such as by driving a significant increase in sales of Fairtrade goods (sales of Fairtrade products rose 18% during 2016),[48] through being the first major UK supermarket to switch all of its own brand meat (excluding continental meats like chorizo) to being British sourced[46] and through reinventing the Society's membership scheme to include a reward of 5% of spend on own brand items being credited to the member and a further 1% being donated to a local cause of their choosing.

Following years of under-investment, the Co-op brought in Mike Bracken, in order to completely re-invent the Society's digital operations and to drive back office efficiencies in the food, funeral and insurance businesses. Focus was also given to re-targeting the insurance business as the preferred insurance provider for Co-op members rather than chasing market share. In 2016 the Co-op announced its intentions to replace its "The Co-operative" branding with revitalised "Co-op" branding from the 1960s, following fears that members associated the branding with the failures of the organisation leading up to 2013.

On 1 March 2017 Richard Pennycook stood down as Group CEO and was succeeded by the CEO of the Co-op's food division, Steve Murrells. This was viewed as representing a shift in the focus of the business from the Rebuilding phase and into a phase of planning for Renewal.[49] In their 2017 annual results the Co-op announced that all of the group's businesses were gaining in market share and that their new membership scheme had led to an additional 700,000 members joining the Society during its first six months,[50] although this news was overshadowed by the group reporting a loss during 2016 after being forced to write off their shareholding in the still troubled Co-operative Bank.[51]
Co-operative practices

As a co-operative, the group places importance on ethical and transparent trading and reporting, and democratic accountability and participation. Individual stores may have member forums. Unlike a pure consumer co-operative, voting rights are shared between the corporate members and the individual consumer members, as described in an annual report:

    Voting for corporate members is in proportion to trade with the society. Each individual member has one vote in the appropriate region of the society and each region has voting rights calculated on the same basis as a corporate member.[52]

    Syncro was the rebranded engineering and building services business of the Co-operative Group, based in Salford. Syncro was sold in 2006.
    Associated Co-operative Creameries (ACC) was the group's milk processing and distribution division. ACC handled logistics of the retail business but this responsibility was transferred to Co-operative Supply Chain Logistics before it was sold to Dairy Farmers of Britain, a farmers co-operative, on 10 August 2004.
    The Co-operative Department Stores business was exited after many years of increasing losses, with several stores being acquired by the Anglia Regional Co-operative Society, and the remainder were closed. Many stores had been in poor locations and had suffered from under-investment. Initially, two stores were to be retained in Perth and Tunbridge Wells to trial a new style of department store, but these were also closed in 2006.
    The Co-operative Motor Group ceased trading following the disposal of Albert Farnell and its last remaining dealerships in 2013. However, Central England Co-operative continued to operate dealerships as The Co-operative Motor Group until 2015.[106][107][108]
    Shoefayre, established in 1959, as Society Shoes was co-owned by several co-operative societies and became owned and managed by the Co-operative Group. In 2006, it reported operating losses of £6 million and in 2007 was sold to Shoe Zone.[109]

Co-operative Pharmacy, St Michael's Hill, Bristol just before the sale to Bestway

    The Co-operative Pharmacy, established as National Co-operative Chemists in 1945, grew to be the third largest community pharmacy group in the UK with nearly 800 branches giving a nationwide presence.

    Co-op Electrical sold electrical products, from kitchenware and white goods to home entertainment. In 2015, the Co-op became the first electrical retailer to sell its extended warranty insurance products at cost price.[112] In the previous decades extended warranties had gained a reputation for being poor value for money, but for being heavily promoted by retailers owing to their high profitability. The business was also unusual in providing a 60-minute delivery time slot, confirmed by SMS on the day of delivery.[113] Co-op Electrical was shut down in March 2019.[114]
    Co-operative Clothing supplied workwear, businesswear & uniforms for catering, construction, beauty and most other industries.[115]

    The Co-operative Travel business was transferred into a new joint venture in 2011 with Thomas Cook and the Central England Co-operative. The Co-operative Group owned a 30% share in the venture which brought together its 401 travel agents with 103 branches owned by Midlands Co-operative, whilst Thomas Cook transferred 803 outlets to create the largest High Street travel agents network in the UK.[117] The merger that created the venture was referred to the Office of Fair Trading as a result of monopoly concerns.[118] The business had direct sales channels through telephone, home workers, and the internet. Prior to the merger, in July 2009 the business launched its own tour operation as a joint venture with Cosmos Holidays. In December 2016 the Co-op announced its intention to sell its stake in the venture to Thomas Cook during 2017, ending over 100 years of trading.[119] The Group notified Thomas Cook of its decision to sell, which required the plc to buy-out its stake. Under the terms of the deal, Thomas Cook paid £50M for the Group's 30% share and £5.8M for Central England Co-operative's 3.5% stake. A guaranteed minimum dividend of £31.9M was also paid, plus interest. On 23 September 2019, Thomas Cook Group's UK travel business was placed into compulsory liquidation and 555 retail outlets were bought by Hays Travel for £6M.[120]

The Co-operative Bank head office building at 1 Balloon Street, Manchester, England

    The Co-operative Bank severed its ownership link with the Co-operative Group in September 2017. The bank had been a wholly owned subsidiary until 2014 when the group was forced to sell the majority of its holding to US hedge fund investors to raise funds for the bank. A campaign was subsequently launched by The Co-operative Party and some customers to sell the bank back to its customers.[121] The Co-operative Bank also includes the internet bank Smile, and the former building society Britannia. A "relationship agreement" between the bank and the group expired in 2020.[122]

    The Co-op Health mobile app was launched in May 2019. The app marked a return to the healthcare sector following the purchase of the repeat prescription app 'Dimec' for around £10m in 2018.[124][125][126] A home delivery service was also available, dispensed from the Co-op's pharmacy at its Lea Green Depot.[127] In March 2021, the business was sold to Phoenix UK, the parent company of the Numark and Rowlands pharmacy networks, for an undisclosed sum.[128]
    Co-op Insurance businesses have been sold over a number of years. In 2013, Royal London Group acquired the Co-operative Insurance Society Limited (CIS) and The Co-operative Asset Management for up to £219M.[129] Royal London now looks after all of the former life assurance, investment and pension businesses owned by the Co-operative Insurance Society. In January 2019, the Co-operative Group announced the sale of its insurance underwriting business for £185M to Markerstudy, to focus on a new insurance distribution business, Co-op Insurance Services. The sale of the underwriting business completed in December 2020.[130]
    Co-op Power was a renewable energy buying business which bulk purchased energy for a range of businesses and organisations. The business also provided energy consultancy services to clients.[131]
    The Co-op petrol station business was sold to Asda for £600 million in August 2022, to strengthen the group's financial position. The 129 petrol forecourt sites made up about 5% of the group's total retail sites.[132]

Marketing and branding
Main article: The Co-operative brand

CWS became Co-operative Group (CWS) Limited on merger with CRS in 2001. CWS Retail was formed in 1933 and demerged in 1957 as CRS, with the purpose of opening shops in co-operative deserts and to take over failing retail societies. The combined Group merged with United Co-operatives, based in Yorkshire and North West England, in 2007, reinforcing its position as the largest consumer co-operative in the world.[133] At this time the current name, Co-operative Group Limited, was adopted.[134]

Following the mergers of the 1990s and 2000s, the modern Co-operative Group was formed of a large range of different independent societies with separate brand identities which led to a lack of consistency and gave an incoherent message to consumers. The four-leaf clover "Co-op" brand, introduced in 1967 and adjusted in 1993, was seen by many in the co-operative movement as a hindrance to public perception of the movement. This problem was affecting the whole co-operative sector in the UK and following the report from the Co-operative Commission in 2001,[135] The Co-operative Group was heavily involved with the process of developing a single updated version of The Co-operative brand for use by many consumers' co-operatives in the UK.

In 2007, the group began a re-brand of its estate to this new unified identity with its other business names, including Travelcare and Funeralcare, phased out in favour of the new The Co-operative business names. With more than 4,000 stores and branches to convert to the new identity the process has been cited as the "largest rebranding exercise in UK corporate history."[136] The Co-operative Group launched its largest television advertising campaign in 2009. The two and a half-minute advertisement aired for the first time during Coronation Street on ITV. The advertisement, created by McCann Erickson, features the Bob Dylan track "Blowin' in the Wind", a rare occasion that he has allowed his music to be used for commercial purposes.
Governance

The Co-operative Group is unusual as a co-op because it is owned by millions of UK consumers and also a number of other UK co-operatives, making the business a hybrid of a primary consumers' co-operative and a co-operative federation. This is largely a function of the group resulting from the merger between the Co-operative Wholesale Society (a co-operative federation) and the Co-operative Retail Services in 2000. Since 2015 The Co-operative Group has operated a 'one member one vote' system whereby any of the Co-op's millions of members can vote to elect board members, to guide strategic decisions and propose their own motions for voting on.

The current governance structure of the business was established in 2014 and comprises an Executive Management Team, a Group Board and a Members' Council.
The Executive Management Team

The Executive Management Team are the highest level of management in the business and are responsible for its day-to-day operations.
The Group Board

The Group Board is a team of between seven and twelve people who are responsible for overseeing the strategy of the business and for holding the executive management team to account.

The Group Board is made up of: a Group Chair; either one or two executive directors appointed from the Executive Management Team; up to five Independent Non-Executive Directors who are not affiliated with the group; and up to four Member-Nominated Directors. Member Nominated Directors (MNDs) are any people from within the membership group who nominate themselves and have the required level of commercial experience.
The National Members' Council

The Members' Council is an elected group of one hundred people who hold the Group Board to account and acts as the guardian of the co-operative Values and Principles. Members of the Co-op, its employees and representatives of the 'independent societies' make up the Members' Council.[137] The council is led by an elected Council president, Denise Scott-McDonald who chairs council meetings. Current members include Nick Crofts and former MEP David Hallam.

Executive remuneration

The Annual Report cites a number of factors in determining executive pay, including "attracting, retaining and motivating senior Executives of the appropriate calibre to further the success of the Group" and "ensuring that the interests of Executives are aligned with those of the Group and its members".

Former CEO Peter Marks was paid a basic salary of £1,014,000 in 2012, with a performance-related bonus of £103,000. The basic salaries of the thirteen executives adds up to £4,836,000, with their performance related bonuses adding up to £240,000.[140]

In March 2014, "private and confidential" documents seen by The Observer newspaper detailed proposals put before The Co-operative's board to double the wage bill for senior management to £12 million a year, whereby the chief executive Euan Sutherland would earn a base salary of £1.5 million and a "retention bonus" of £1.5 million.[141] The Observer also reported that Rebecca Skitt, the Co-op's chief human resources officer, who joined in February 2013, left 12 months later "with a proposed pay-off totalling more than £2M".
Member Owner Governance Structure 2007 to 2015

Between the creation of The Co-operative Group in 2000 and the major governance changes of 2014–2015, the Group had a complex governance arrangement which consisted of the business executive, the Group Board of twenty people, a series of regional boards and numerous area committees. This could be likened to English local, county and national government, where society members stood for election and if successful were expected to represent members at all levels of the society, simultaneously, with positions held in on co-op committees corresponding to departments (the businesses boards), the cabinet (the national Board), devolved nations and regions (Regional Boards), counties and parish councils (Area Committees), plus doing press events and engaging with neighbourhoods and communities such as a highly paid professional member a national government might face: quite a task for volunteer laypeople.

The Group Board was made up of fifteen "lay" member directors elected from regional boards, another five which came from the "independent societies" and, though there was the option to appoint up to three "independent professional non-executive directors" (IPNEDs) to the Group Board at any one time, only one was ever appointed.

All Group Board members (excluding IPNEDs) were appointed by competitive regional election – in contrast, most building societies and PLCs have a nominations committee consisting of members of the executive which picks potential board members and puts them up for uncontested elections.

A series of regional boards, consisting of twelve to fifteen people elected from area committees, were responsible for holding the Group Board to account and for block-voting at the Annual General Meeting. There were 48 area committees which were responsible for representing member interests and promoting membership within their constituency.

Out of the millions of members that the Group had, only area committee members were able to vote in the elections for the regional boards and "lay" director seats on the Group Board and the votes were weighted depending on the value of sales within individual areas.

One of the justifications for this complex governance arrangement was that it took a number of years to reach regional board level, which helped to minimise the influence of single-issue campaigners and carpet-baggers. In the 1990s it was these issues, notably the failed take-over by Andrew Regan in 1997, which caused significant problems for the, then, CRS and CWS.

The Myners Review noted that "the primary source of power within the Group [was] firmly entrenched at the level of the Regional Boards", replicating the roles of the predecessor regional societies in voting a century before, and the review concluded that it was this 'labyrinthine' structure, where Group Board members need to remain elected to Area Committees and regional boards, which led to the governance problems at the Co-op and its financial crisis of 2013.[7]
Dividend and membership scheme

The idea of co-operative trading revolutionised food retailing with the dividend, often known as "divi", and the "divi number" became a part of British life. The way in which co-operative retail societies are run for the benefit, and on behalf of their members sets them apart from their modern-day competitors. The dividend is a financial reward to members based on each member's level of trade with the society. The distribution of profits on the basis of turnover rather than capital invested is a fundamental difference between a co-operative and most private sector enterprises.
History of co-op membership
Co-op savings stamp book, 1980s

Historically, members' sales would be recorded in ledgers in society's stores and at the end of the collection period a proportional payment would be made to the member. As the societies grew, and the number of members increased, the method of using ledgers became cumbersome. As a solution, some societies, including Co-operative Retail Services, issued stamps to members for qualifying transactions. Members collected stamps on a savings card and, when the card was complete, would use it as payment for goods or deposit into their share account.

By the late 20th century the group's predecessors and then the Co-operative Group no longer paid true dividend as it had become a drain on limited resources, although several independent societies (such as Anglia Regional) continued to do so. In the mid-1990s a loyalty card scheme, in the style of the Tesco Clubcard, was introduced which used the dividend brand.[142] These loyalty cards were inspired by the co-operative dividend but were little more than marketing exercises and a way to gather useful customer information. Co-operative customers, not just members, could sign up and receive a swipe card to record purchases with vouchers sent out twice a year which could be exchanged for cash or goods.

In September 2006 the Co-operative Group relaunched "true" dividend whereby a proportion of the profits of the Co-operative Group is returned to members. To emphasise the change, the scheme is now called the Co-operative Membership and members earn a "share of the profits". New members are recruited by allowing them to deduct the refundable subscription for a £1 share from their first dividend. Members can collect points to increase their share of the profits by using the services provided across the whole family of businesses. In 2008, the dividend almost doubled to £38 million, equivalent to 2.63p per point (one point being earned for each £1 food purchase), reflecting an 8% increase in underlying profit.[143]

Group membership increased sharply in the first year after the relaunch, to 2.5 million with many more young people who have an affinity with the co-operative values and principles attracted to join.[144][145][146]

In 2007, the Oxford-based Midcounties Co-operative became an affinity partner of the group's membership scheme, allowing its members to earn dividend at Co-operative Group stores and vice versa. Since then, other independent co-operatives have joined the reciprocal membership dividend scheme, including Central England Co-operative (merged from Anglia and Midlands who joined in 2008 and 2010 respectively), Southern Co-operative (2009) and Chelmsford Star Co-operative Society (2009). Southern Co-operative withdrew from the affinity partnership scheme in 2021.[147] This reciprocal membership agreement means members of these societies can earn membership points at more than 90% of UK co-operative outlets. Dividend payments are made at the rate of the society where the points were earned, not the society of the member, although the member's society is responsible for distributing the payment.
Current membership scheme

The current Co-op membership scheme was launched in September 2016 and rewarded members with 5% of what they spent on own-brand products and services being credited back to their membership account. A further 1% was donated to a local charitable or community cause which the members help to select. Additionally, it is expected that members will still earn their share of the profits when the member dividend returns. Though the independent societies have not participated in the 5+1% scheme, members can earn the points (from which the profit share is derived) at five of the largest consumer's co-operatives within the UK owing to the reciprocal membership scheme (described above).

On 30 September 2020, the Co-op changed some of the rewards associated with membership. This increased the community reward to 2% but reduced the member reward from 5% to 2%; the change still calculates rewards when Co-op branded goods are bought. An app was also launched which allows immediate discounts and offers to be activated, exclusively for members. This has since been changed with members no longer receiving rewards for buying Co-op branded goods. Instead members receive discounts off selected branded and own-brand goods.
Ethical trading and campaigning

As the UK's largest co-operative, the group plays a key part in the co-operative movement. In the 1840s the original co-op shops were set up to protect consumers from adulterated food and profiteering shopkeepers. Since then the co-operative movement has campaigned on a number of issues which they thought were key consumer interests. As a part of this, The Co-operative Group has long been campaigning for consumer rights legislation, researching into new food labelling initiatives, a major sponsor of new co-operative ventures, a notable donor to community initiatives, directly involved in the development of animal welfare standards and in championing Fairtrade in the UK.

The Co-op has traded on its 'ethical' credentials for many years and in 2014 a survey suggested that 70% of the British public believed that it was a business that 'tried to do the right thing'.[148] The co-op is particularly known for its work in championing the introduction of Fairtrade in the UK, investing in renewable energy and in reducing its carbon emissions, in maintaining high standards of animal welfare, in being a leading retailer of responsible fish, for reinvesting its profits in local communities and for campaigning on a range of social issues.

The Co-operative is widely recognised for its commitment to responsible and ethical trading, particularly for championing fairtrade in the UK.[149] These commitments and its mutual structure led to The Co-operative Food being awarded Ethical Consumer magazine's 'Best Buy' status in 2011 and 2014.[150] Following significant public outcry regarding the Tax avoidance of many well known multi-national companies the co-op was awarded the Fair Tax Mark in 2015, an independent certification designed to identify businesses which are not aggressively seeking to avoid paying taxes.

Each year the business publishes a sustainability report on its website with a breakdown of the key social, environmental and charitable activities which were undertaken during the previous financial year.[151] In 2008 the company was awarded the European Business Award for the Environment (Management category) by the European Union for its commitment to combine competitiveness with respect for the environment.[152]
Fairtrade

The Co-operative Group was the first major UK retailer to stock Fairtrade products and was the first UK supermarket to sell Fairtrade coffee (1992), bananas (2000), own-brand chocolate (2000), own-brand wine (2001), pineapples (2002), sugar (2005) and blueberries (2010).[153] Since then, all own brand block chocolate (2002), coffee (2003), sugar (2008), bananas (2012), winter blueberries (2012) has been converted to Fairtrade. Co-op Food is also the largest UK retailer of fairly traded wine and has the largest range of Fairtrade products in the UK. In 2014 its Fairtrade sales were £133M.[154][155] During 2017, the Co-op became the first UK retailer to source all of the cocoa for their own label products on Fairtrade terms, a move which increased their volumes of Fairtrade cocoa fivefold.[156]

The Co-op's "Beyond Fairtrade" programme is run in addition to paying the standard 'Fairtrade Premium' payment. The programme has included working with many groups of smallholder farmers to establish democratic co-operative businesses to sell their product (to suppliers including the Co-op) and through the Co-op providing investment funding to enable the farming co-operatives who supply them to convert to Fairtrade certification. £475,000 in funding was provided between 2012 and 2014 for this programme.[157] The business has also been involved in developing certification schemes for additional Fairtrade products (in association with the Fairtrade Foundation and Traidcraft) including wine (2001), rubber gloves (2014), coffins (2012) and charcoal (2009).[158]
Renewable energy and energy saving measures

Since 2005, 98% of The Co-op's electricity has been sourced through renewable sources, notably wind power, hydro and anaerobic digestion. By 2014, 12.3% of the business's total energy use was being sourced from renewable sources. The business has also constructed its own renewable energy generation facilities, including three wind farms, though these were sold in 2016. When combined with improvements in its supply chain, notably a reduction in fuel used in its vehicle fleet, and the fitting of doors to its store refrigerators (a measure which reduces their energy consumption by 40%)[159] this led to a 40% reduction in its carbon emissions between 2006 and 2015.[160] The Co-op also buys renewable energy from community energy projects including Torrs Hydro and Settle Hydro.[161][162]
Animal welfare

In 1994 The Co-operative Group became the first retailer to support the development of the then new RSPCA Freedom Food scheme with the aim of improving welfare standards for animals at all stages of the food chain. Their range of "freedom foods" certified products began from around this time.[163] The Co-op also has a range of animal welfare standards for its own brand chicken, pork and turkey products which are more strict than UK legal requirements. It has also labelled the living conditions of the hens which lay its eggs in the 1990s and became the first retailer to switch to only using free-range eggs in all own brand products.[164] In 2025, from discussions with the International Council for Animal Welfare (ICAW) and the Aquatic Life Institute (ALI), as well as mounting public attention over the treatment of crustaceans in the seafood industry, The Co-op successfully ended the controversial practice of eyestalk ablation from its supply chain.[165]

As a result of these policies, The Co-operative was awarded a 'Tier 2' standard by the 'Business Benchmark on Farm Animal Welfare' for 2013.[166] In this report The Co-operative was recognised for banning the prophylactic use of antibiotics or any other artificial substance for use in promoting abnormal animal growth in all own brand products; prophylactic antibiotic use is found in the majority of meat sold in Europe but has been linked to the development of antibiotic resistant infections such as certain strains of E. coli.[167] The business only allows antibiotics to be administered "with the specific written approval of a vet to address a specific health threat." The business also limits any journey time when transporting of livestock to 6 hours, but most journeys should be under 1 hour.[168]
Responsible fish sourcing

The Co-operative is one of the leading retailers of responsible fish in the UK having launched its Responsible Fish Sourcing Policy in 2008 after commissioning research in association with NGOs, academics and its suppliers. This report was subsequently updated in 2014.[169] The Co-operative Food was commended by the Marine Conservation Society with a "gold award" (2011) and a "silver award" (2013) and, for its sourcing policy, The Co-operative was one of five organisations accredited with the 2010 Seafood Champion Award.[170]

Since 2011 all own-brand tuna has been caught using the pole and line method and does not use "Fish Aggregation Devices", a method with a significantly lower by-catch rate when compared with conventional tuna fishing. Since 2012, all farmed salmon has been certified by the RSPCA Freedom Foods accreditation scheme.[171] In 2008 the Co-op committed £200,000 to enable fisheries which would struggle to fund the certification process to become accredited by the Marine Stewardship Council.[172]

In 2015 the Co-op became one of the first retailers to join the "Ocean Disclosure Project" which requires the business to report transparently on the geographic locations, fishing methods and sustainability characteristics of all of the fisheries from which they source.[173][174] This move confirmed an ongoing commitment by The Co-operative Food in promoting transparent and responsible fishing in the UK.
Community dividend

Like many co-operatives, The Co-operative Group runs a community dividend scheme where each year a share of the businesses profits are re-invested into the communities where they trade. In 2002 the group gave 5.4 per cent of their annual operative profits to communities as their community dividend for the year – a total figure of £10.7M.[163]
Co-operative development

The Co-operative Group, like most co-operatives, has supported the development of co-operative businesses in many sectors of the economy through its "Enterprise Hub". This has provided financial and business management help to small and start-up co-operatives, notably including F.C. United of Manchester, public service mutuals and a number of community pub ventures.
Clean energy campaigning

Between 2011 and 2013 the group campaigned on the issue of climate change under its banner of "The Clean Energy Revolution".[175] There were three main aspects to this campaigning:

    Campaigning to increase awareness of climate change generally;
    Campaigning specifically around contentions associated with fossil fuel extraction; and
    Assisting the development of community renewable energy projects in the UK.

In addition to this, the business has provided on targets to reducing its own environmental impact including reducing direct GHG emissions by 50% relative to 2006.[176]

As a part of its attempts to highlight the problem of climate change and specific issues relating to fossil fuel extraction, the group campaigned against tar sands oil extraction and fracking. To this end, The Co-operative Group part-funded the UK release of films including Chasing Ice, Gasland and H2Oil[177] to raise awareness of the cause and, as a part of this, local members organised screenings in various communities.[178] In 2011 the Co-op wrote an open letter to the Defra which was signed by 190 large organisations and businesses calling upon the government to introduce mandatory carbon emissions reporting[179] – a measure introduced for "businesses listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange" in 2013.[180]

The Toxic Fuels campaign was launched to combat the proposed expansion of the Canadian tar sands and proposals to begin fracking at sites in the UK. In 2008 they joined with the WWF-UK to publish a report which concluded that exploiting the Canadian tar sands to their full potential would be sufficient to bring about what they described as "runaway climate change".[181] The Co-operative Bank were also vocal supporters of the Beaver Lake Cree Nation's legal action against expanding oil extraction in Alberta, raising and donating over C$400,000 to support the BLCN legal case and focusing media attention in the UK – which led to a protest outside the Canadian Embassy in London.[182][183][184][185] Colin Baines, Campaigns Manager at The Co-operative Group described the Beaver Lake Cree Nation legal action as "perhaps the best chance we have to stop tar sands expansion".[186] In 2013, the court ruled in favour of the Beaver Lake Cree on appeal.[187]

The Co-op were also involved in shareholder resolutions at BP and Shell's 2010 AGM over this issue of tar sands extraction.[188][189] A further report published with the WWF was critical of the prospect of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology being used to reduce the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to a level comparable to that of other methods of oil extraction.[190] In the report they claimed that it was this belief in CCS that the oil industry were using to justify their continued investment in the tar sands.

In 2011, The Co-operative Group called for a moratorium on fracking in the UK "at least until all the associated risks are fully exposed and understood".[191][192] This position was based upon a report which the Co-op commissioned and which was produced by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research.[193] The report concluded that the implementation of fracking in the UK posed three potential problems:

    the likelihood of increased greenhouse gas emissions;
    the potential for contamination of groundwater by heavy metals and chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process; and
    the diversion of investment funds away from renewable energy research and development.[193]

Another Co-op funded report concluded that the hypothesised emissions benefits from converting from coal to gas (from fracking) had been overstated.[194] As a part of their attempts to increase public awareness of fracking in the UK, the Co-op encouraged members to organise screenings of the film Gasland across the UK.[195] This move received some criticism, notably from The Daily Telegraph due to perceptions of bias in the film Gasland.[196]

The Co-operative Group has been a vocal supporter of community-owned renewable projects for a number of years as a way to combat climate change and fuel poverty. In 2012, the Co-op launched its "Community Energy Manifesto" in association with Co-operatives UK which contained research into the possibility for significant growth in the UK's community renewable sector and it provided a number of case studies.[197] The Co-operative Group, notably through The Co-operative Bank and The Co-operative Enterprise Hub, has provided almost £100M in loans and grants to community-run energy efficiency and renewable energy generation co-operatives (including the Baywind Energy Co-operative and Torrs Hydro).[198] In 2014 the Co-op launched its Community Energy Challenge which worked to encourage community energy schemes across the UK by actively supporting the groups for 18 months to raise awareness of community renewables and to create co-operatively and community-owned and schemes of over 500 kW in size that could be replicated across the country.[199] However, since the problems at The Co-operative Bank the funding for new projects has largely been discontinued.
Food and product labelling
The rear nutritional information panel for a pack of own brand sausages

The Co-operative Group became the first retailer to list the ingredients in its own-brand wines on the label in 1999 in a move that was illegal at the time. They justified their move by stating that they "believe it's in the consumer's interest" to know what is in their wine – as many ingredients, including charcoal and fish finings, have been used to give wines distinctive flavours. Ten years later the UK government pushed for labelling of this kind.[200][201]

In 2001, the group became the first retailer to include Braille writing on its range of medicines and alcoholic drinks.[200] By 2015 this had expanded so Braille could be found on many products, including breakfast cereals.[202][203]

In 2013, the Co-operative Group modified their own front-of-pack labelling scheme to combine both the traffic light and guideline daily amount schemes into one system.[204] In 2009 the Co-op also introduced a 'green dot' scheme where additional specifically defined nutritional benefits in products (e.g. over 6 g of fibre per 100 g) were included on the front of the pack.[205] Since 2003, the Co-op has been using a similar system to highlight products which count towards one's '5 a day' fruit and veg – also listing the quantity of the product which required to reach the required serving size.
Russia boycott

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine the Co-op halted the sale of Russian products.[206]
Israel boycott

At the end of April 2012, The Co-operative Group announced that it was "no longer engaging with any supplier of produce known to be sourcing from Israeli settlements." This involved the ending of contracts amounting to around £350,000 with a number of companies sourcing products from settlements built on Palestinian claimed territories, but not Israeli companies in general.[207]

Co-op members voted on a consultative motion to remove Israeli goods from store shelves during the organization's annual general meeting in London on 19 May 2025. In this meeting, 73 percent of members overwhelmingly supported the motion, citing the ongoing genocide in Gaza. If implemented, this decision would make the Co-op the first British supermarket chain to boycott Israeli goods.[206][208]
Pesticides and toxic chemicals

In 2000, the Group introduced a pesticide policy which banned, restricted and monitored pesticide use at farms which supply its own brand products. The policy aims to minimise the use of chemicals, and the residues which remain on crops, whilst providing safe food but without notably increasing the cost of products,[200] a move which was endorsed by consumer and environmental groups.[209][210][211] This move resulted from research that the business, then the CWS, conducted which demonstrated that two-thirds of those asked were either concerned or very concerned about the health and environmental effects of pesticides and their residues on foods.[212] The Co-op was the first supermarket to publicise all monitoring pesticide results on the business's website so that members could access the data.[213] The Co-op publish the results of their monthly pesticide monitoring on their website[214][215] and this indicates that between 2009 and 2015 on average approximately 40% of tested foods had no traces of any of the 449 monitored pesticides and that since 2012 none of the banned pesticides have been observed.[216] After recognising the potential for bioaccumulation of the toxic chemicals used in manufacturing and agriculture, the group joined with the WWF-UK on a campaign called DETOX which called for research into new safer chemicals which do no bioaccumulate.[217]

The Co-operative became the first UK supermarket to ban the use of neonicotinoid pesticides in any of their own brand products or on their farms in 2009, after Germany, Italy and Slovenia banned the chemicals in 2008 in response to a sharp decline in their country's bee population.[218] The business invested over £300,000 in funding peer-reviewed research on the impact of neonicotinoids on bee populations, campaigned for a ban of neonicotinoids and called on the UK government to support the proposed EU ban in 2013.[219][220] They suggested that if they, then the UK's largest farmer, had banned neonicotinoids in their products and on their farms four years earlier, then it would be possible for the ban to be successfully implemented without significant impact on European farming.[221] As a part of their 'Plan Bee' policy they also funded the UK release of the documentary film Vanishing of the Bees to raise awareness of the issue, gave away 300,000 packets of wildflower seeds to members, offered discounted bee boxes for sale to members and under-used urban areas into colourful community meadows.[222][223]
Genetic modification

In 1994, the Co-operative Group began labelling own brands food which contained genetically modified (GM) ingredients and, five years later, they banned the use of GM ingredients in its own-brand products including GM animal feed.[200] Since 2003 the Co-op has banned the growing of GM crops on their own land (at the time they were the largest lowland UK farming business). The group also published a report on genetic modification which suggested that the majority of customers and members did not support GM crops.[224] In 2013 the Co-op dropped its objection to GM chicken and turkey feed and allowed its suppliers to use such feeds, owing to the increasing difficulty in sourcing guaranteed non-GM feeds.[225]
Waste reduction and carrier bags

Total waste from the business has decreased by 41% since 2006 with 95% of all waste now being either reused or recycled. Product packaging for own brand items has been reduced by 40% since 2006 (by weight). In line with regulations, the Co-op prints information on the recyclability of product packaging on the label. In 2014 over 80% of packaging (by weight – 45% by product line) was widely recyclable.[226]

In 2002, the Co-op launched its degradable carrier bags, however, these were later withdrawn in favour of recyclable and reusable bags. However, with the increasing prevalence of council refuse collection services across the UK which compost food and garden waste, the Co-op launched a new carrier bag in 2014 which could be used to by the customer to line their food waste bin once they had used the bag to get their shopping home.[227] All profits from the sale of the entire carrier bag range (above the legal charge) are distributed to community projects.

The Co-operative distributes food waste to FareShare with the equivalent of 196,000 redistributed in 2014 and no food waste was sent to landfill.[citation needed]
Supply chain efficiency

The Co-op Food Supply Chain Logistics business makes 35,000 deliveries per week and it has invested heavily in increasing the efficiency of its supply and distribution networks with the aims of reducing its costs and environmental impact. Between 2006 and 2013 the Co-op reduced its fuel consumption by 29% and its emissions from supply chain activities by 31%. In 2013 the society closed six "legacy" distribution centres and opened two new sites which won awards for their low environmental impact.[228] By switching much of its England to Scotland traffic from road to electric train in 2010 it has taken more than 10,000 tonnes of goods from the road network, making a significant greenhouse gas emissions saving. The business has also started collecting goods from its suppliers itself using lorries returning from store deliveries which would otherwise have travelled empty. The business became the first major business to trial an aerodynamic truck, 'the dolphin' in 2013 which was specifically designed to maximise fuel efficiency and reduce costs.[229] The business has also expanded its road fleet into double-decker and 15-metre semi-trailers to reduce the number of lorry journeys required.[230]
Palm oil policy

Palm oil is significant as it has one of the highest yields per hectare of any oil, however, its production has been linked to significant deforestation and habitat loss, particularly across Africa and South America. In order to reduce this impact The Co-operative became the first major supermarket to commit to only using certified sustainable palm oil in its own brand products.[231] During 2014 the Co-op was awarded 'Best Buy' status by the 'Rainforest Foundation UK' (RFUK) and Ethical Consumer magazine for its use of certified palm oil products and for its palm oil policy.[232][233] Palm oil for The Co-op is certified by the following standards: UTZ Certified (40%), the use of a segregated supply chain (39%) and with GreenPalm certificates (21%). All of these approaches are supported by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil of which The Co-operative Group is a member.[234]
2025 cyber incident

In April 2025, The Co-op announced that it shut down parts of its IT systems in response to hackers attempting to gain access to them. It said the "proactive measures" it had taken to fend off the attack had had a "small impact" on its call centre and back office.[235] Co-op later confirmed that personal data for all of its 6.5 million members had been stolen by the hackers.[236]
List of corporate members
See also: British co-operative movement § Consumer and food

As of 2011, 22 independent consumer co-operatives are corporate members or customer-owners, of the group. They invested share capital to found or join the group's wholesaler predecessors, such as the North of England Co-operative Wholesale Industrial and Provident Society and the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society. These co-operatives are represented alongside the regional boards at annual meetings and in the board of directors, and are entitled to dividends based on the amount of their purchases from the group.

The corporate members do not have exclusive rights to operate in any category or geography; especially with food there are examples of one or more corporate members below operating in the same local area and/or overlapping with shops of The Cooperative group, and the various websites listed below may or may not highlight categories or store locations relevant to a customer's needs or location.
